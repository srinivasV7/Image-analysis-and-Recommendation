It is the most heavily travelled trail because the trailhead is right by the Bright Angel Lodge at Grand Canyon Village. This is the trail that the tourist mule trains use.

Bob Ribokas (CanyonCat on Flickr) at Grand Canyon Explorer &lt;a href&quot;http:bobspixels.comkaibab.orgbcgc_tr_ob.htm&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;bobspixels.comkaibab.orgbcgc_tr_ob.htm&lt;a&gt; &amp;quot;The Old Bright Angel Trail and the current Bright Angel Trail have nothing in common except the name. They are on opposite sides of the Canyon and worlds apart for all practical purposes. This should not surprise anyone who has been to the Canyon as a good number of things there have Bright Angel as part of their names. But with a trail that is supposed to go from one place to another, it just confuses the issue. The Old Bright Angel Trail was originally blazed by a man by the name of Francois Emile Matthes, who surveyed the area for the United States Geological Survey in 1902. The original trail supposedly criss-crossed Bright Angel Creek 94 times before it reached the Colorado River. The trail was upgraded between 1924 and 1928 by E.D. Woolley and the Grand Canyon Transportation Company in an effort to bring tourists across the Canyon to visit the north rim. After the Park Service completed the modern North Kaibab Trail the Old Bright Angel fell into disuse and deteriorated.&amp;quot; I spent a long weekend hiking, backpacking and camping on the North Rim and down the North Kaibab Trail. &lt;a href&quot;http:hikearizona.comdecoder.php?ZTN417&amp;amp;start0&amp;amp;EXTT#45027&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hikearizona.comdecoder.php?ZTN417&amp;amp;start0&amp;amp;EXTT...&lt;a&gt; </field> <field name="id">3892187606</field> <field name="location">36.192797,-112.032566</field><field name="license">2</field><field name="nbComments">0</field><field name="rank">175</field><field name="tags">park camping arizona rock nationalpark hiking grandcanyon grand az canyon hike formation trail national backpacking backcountry northrim 大峽谷 grandcanyonnationalpark northkaibabtrail cottonwoodcampground gcnp brightangelcanyon グランドキャニオン alhikesaz 亚利桑那 亞利桑那 gcnr2009 oldbrightangeltrail</field><field name="title">Bright Angel Canyon - Grand Canyon North Rim</field><field name="url_b">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2545/3892187606_c531456ea6_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">Al_HikesAZ</field><field name="poi">angel of the north</field><field name="date_taken">2010-04-25T13:13:59Z</field><field name="description">This is Eric&apos;s Six Moon Designs Lunar Solo at the Bright Angel Campground just south of Phantom Ranch.

Grand Canyon Lodge is a hotel and cabins complex at Bright Angel Point on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. It was designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood who also designed The Ahwahnee, Bryce Canyon Lodge, and Zion Lodge. Grand Canyon Lodge is a resort complex consisting of a Main Lodge building, 23 deluxe cabins, and 91 standard cabins, some of which were moved to the north rim campground in 1940. Grand Canyon Lodge is the most intact rustic hotel development in the National Park system remaining from the railroad era. Constructed of native Kaibab limestone and timber, the complex was designed to harmonize with its rocky and forested setting. When constructed in 1927-28, Grand Canyon Lodge consisted of the Main Lodge building (burned in 1932, but rebuilt in 1936-37), 20 deluxe cabins, and 100 standard cabins. 20 additional cabins were constructed in 1928. Gilbert Stanley Underwood was employed by the Union Pacific Railroad to design resort hotels at Zion, Bryce Canyon, Yosemite, and Grand Canyon. The most important features of the Grand Canyon Lodge complex were based on Underwood&apos;s design. He purposefully designed the stonework to appear like natural rock outcroppings. The main lodge building is banked into the side of the canyon and is the complex&apos;s central feature.[3] It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. &lt;a href&quot;https:en.wikipedia.orgwikiGrand_Canyon_Lodge&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiGrand_Canyon_Lodge&lt;a&gt; From the National Register of Historic Places Grand Canyon Inn and Campground (added 1982 - - #82001872) Also known as North Rim Inn and Campground North Rim , Grand Canyon National Park Historic Significance: Event, ArchitectureEngineering Architect, builder, or engineer: Underwood,Gilbert Stanley, Utah Parks Co.
