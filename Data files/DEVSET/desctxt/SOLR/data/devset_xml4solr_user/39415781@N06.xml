The Etang de Berre, situated between Marseille and the Camargue, has the largest petroleum refinery industry in France, which dominates the landscape. However, on the inland side of the Canal de Caronte is the former fishing port and artists&apos; colony of Martigues, which still attracts a holiday crowd. Martigues lies on both banks of the canal and on the island of Brescon, where the Pont San Sebastien is a popular place for artists to set up their easels. Felix Ziem (1821-1911) was the most ardent admirer of this &amp;quot;little Venice&amp;quot;; his paintings and works by contemporary artists can be viewed in the Musee Ziem. From DK Eyewitness Travel: Provence &amp;amp; The Cote D&apos;Azur &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiMartigues&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Martigues&lt;a&gt; on Wikipedia Martigues (Occitan: Lo Martegue in classical norm, Lou Martegue in Mistralian norm) is a commune northwest of Marseille. It is part of the Bouches-du-Rhône department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&apos;Azur region on the eastern end of the Canal de Caronte. A direct translation from the Martigues Tourisme Website reveals the following about Martigues: Nicknamed the &amp;quot;Provençale Venice&amp;quot;, Martigues is a point of passage between the Mediterranean Sea and the Sea of Martigues (now Etang de Berre), close to the Côte d&apos;Azur. The charm of its canals, its docks and bridges made it &amp;quot;The Venice of Provence&amp;quot;. Martigues possesses also its cooperative winery &amp;quot;La Venise provençale&amp;quot;: Coteaux d&apos;Aix en Provence, rosé, red and white wines, fruit juices and natural oils in the region. Main varietals: Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault, Carignan, Clairette. A church in Quai Marceau, Martigues. It is l&apos;église Sainte-Madeleine. The Church of Sainte-Madeleine (Martigues) (Church of the Madeleine), Ward Island, baroque style, was built between 1681 and 1688. Its interior is richly decorated with murals and woodwork, original flat ceiling with wood paintings. A beautiful organ of the mid-nineteenth century is present, it is classified as historical monuments. Rich carved facade and bell tower topped by an iron bell.

The bridge, with its exuberant Art Nouveau lamps, cherubs, nymphs and winged horses at either end, was built between 1896 and 1900. It is named after Tsar Alexander III, who had concluded the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1892. His son Nicholas II laid the foundation stone in October 1896. The style of the bridge reflects that of the Grand Palais, to which it leads on the right bank. The construction of the bridge is a marvel of 19th century engineering, consisting of a six-metre high single span steel arch. The design, by the architects Joseph Cassien-Bernard and Gaston Cousin, was subject to strict controls that prevented the bridge from obscuring the view of the Champs-Élysées or the Invalides. The bridge was built by the engineers Jean Résal and Amédée d&apos;Alby and inaugurated in 1900 for the Universal Exhibition (as were the nearby Grand Palais and Petit Palais). The Pont Alexandre III is classified as a historical monument. Numerous sculptors provided the sculpture that features prominently in the bridge. Four gilt-bronze statues of Fames watch over the bridge, supported on massive 17-meter socles, that provide stabilizing counterweight for the arch, without interfering with monumental views.

Grand Palais beside the bridge Grand Palais, &amp;quot;Great Palace&amp;quot; in English, is a glass and Art-Nouveau ironwork building located in the 8th arondissement of París. Construction was begun in 1897, for the Paris Exhibition of 1891. &amp;quot;Monument consecrated by the Republic for the glory of the French Arts&amp;quot; as written on its walls, its original purpose was to collect the greatest artistic works from the French capital. On June 12, 1975, the central nave of the building was registered as a historic monument. On the 6th of November, 2000, the entire Great Palace achieved this protection. Over time, it has had various uses. It was closed from 1993 to 2005 after one of the glass ceiling panels fell. Now it is restored and its over 400,000 sq. ft. of space regularly host picture exhibition &amp;quot;salons&amp;quot;.

Grand Palais beside the bridge Grand Palais, &amp;quot;Great Palace&amp;quot; in English, is a glass and Art-Nouveau ironwork building located in the 8th arondissement of París. Construction was begun in 1897, for the Paris Exhibition of 1891. &amp;quot;Monument consecrated by the Republic for the glory of the French Arts&amp;quot; as written on its walls, its original purpose was to collect the greatest artistic works from the French capital. On June 12, 1975, the central nave of the building was registered as a historic monument. On the 6th of November, 2000, the entire Great Palace achieved this protection. Over time, it has had various uses. It was closed from 1993 to 2005 after one of the glass ceiling panels fell. Now it is restored and its over 400,000 sq. ft. of space regularly host picture exhibition &amp;quot;salons&amp;quot;.
