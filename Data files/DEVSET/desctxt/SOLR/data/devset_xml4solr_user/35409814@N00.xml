And St Benedict goes on: &apos;Let us then consider how we ought to behave ourselves in the presence of God and His angels, and so sing the psalms that mind and voice may be in harmony&apos;… It is, therefore, not at all the case that man contrives something and then sings it, but rather the song comes to him from the angelic choirs, and he must raise his heart on high so that it can harmonize with the tune which comes to him. But above all else this is important: the sacred liturgy is not something which [we] manufacture or produce. It is already there before [us]. It is entering into the heavenly liturgy that has always been taking place. Earthly liturgy is liturgy because and only because it joins what is already in process, the greater reality&amp;quot; - Joseph Ratzinger, A New Song for the Lord, p166.

When he had reached a certain place he passed the night there, since the sun had set. Taking one of the stones to be found at that place, he made it his pillow and lay down where he was. He had a dream: a ladder was there, standing on the ground with its top reaching to heaven; and there were angels of God going up it and coming down. And the Lord was there, standing over him, saying, ‘I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac. I will give to you and your descendants the land on which you are lying. Your descendants shall be like the specks of dust on the ground; you shall spread to the west and the east, to the north and the south, and all the tribes of the earth shall bless themselves by you and your descendants. Be sure that I am with you; I will keep you safe wherever you go, and bring you back to this land, for I will not desert you before I have done all that I have promised you.’ Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, ‘Truly, the Lord is in this-place and I never knew it!’ He was afraid and said, ‘How awe-inspiring this place is! This is nothing less than a house of God; this is the gate of heaven!’ Rising early in the morning, Jacob took the stone he had used for his pillow, and set it up as a monument, pouring oil over the top of it. He named the place Bethel, but before that the town was called Luz. Jacob made this vow, ‘If God goes with me and keeps me safe on this journey I am making, if he gives me bread to eat and clothes to wear, and if I return home safely to my father, then the Lord shall be my God. This stone I have set up as a monument shall be a house of God.’&amp;quot; - Genesis 28:10-12, which is today&apos;s first reading at Mass.

When it came time for consecration, the Roman noblewoman who had baked the bread for the Eucharist began to laugh in disbelief that the fruit of her oven could become the Body and Blood of Christ. Pope Gregory, dismayed at her lack of faith, refused her Communion, but as he prayed over the Host, it transformed visibly into flesh. The woman fell to her knees repentant. The relics of this miracle are now in Andechs, Germany. This beautiful detail of the miraculous Mass of St Gregory is from a 15th-century stained glass window is in All Saints&apos; North Street in York. Today, 23 June 2011, is the feast of Corpus Christi, when we venerate this great sacrament of the Mass in which Christ is present in the Host.</field> <field name="id">5862117267</field> <field name="location">0,0</field><field name="license">3</field><field name="nbComments">0</field><field name="rank">259</field><field name="tags">york pope glass saint christ miracle jesus medieval stained host angels mass mitre allsaints eucharist stgregorythegreat</field><field name="title">Eucharistic Miracle of St Gregory</field><field name="url_b">http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5188/5862117267_811a4fcbc9_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">Lawrence OP</field><field name="poi">angel of the north</field><field name="date_taken">2009-07-31T10:46:48Z</field><field name="description">For the last day of this Liturgical Year: Christ seated in judgment surrounded by angels and saints from the north transept door of Burgos Cathedral.</field> <field name="id">4140494070</field> <field name="location">0,0</field><field name="license">3</field><field name="nbComments">3</field><field name="rank">260</field><field name="tags">door españa spain christ cathedral jesus saints unesco angels burgos judgment tympanum</field><field name="title">Christ in Judgment</field><field name="url_b">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2631/4140494070_49f58740f2_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">Lawrence OP</field><field name="poi">angel of the north</field><field name="date_taken">2010-08-21T14:20:22Z</field><field name="description">&amp;quot;All wisdom comes from the Lord and is with him for ever. The sand of the sea, the drops of rain, and the days of eternity -- who can count them? The height of heaven, the breadth of the earth, the abyss, and wisdom -- who can search them out?&amp;quot; - Ecclesiasticus 1:1-3, which is part of today&apos;s first reading at Mass. The answer to the question of Sirach, of course, is that only the Lord can, and the Gospels portray Christ as the Lord of heaven, earth, and the elements. We see him calming the sea, but also (as this window shows vividly), Christ has command over the demons, which is recounted in today&apos;s Gospel from Mark 9:14-29 This is the lower part of a wonderful window from the north transept of St Giles&apos; Cathedral in Edinburgh of &apos;Christ stilling the Tempest&apos;.

The water flowed from under the right side of the Temple, south of the altar. He took me out by the north gate and led me right round outside as far as the outer east gate where the water flowed out on the right-hand side. The man went to the east holding his measuring line and measured off a thousand cubits; he then made me wade across the stream; the water reached my ankles. He measured off another thousand and made me wade across the stream again; the water reached my knees. He measured off another thousand and made me wade across again; the water reached my waist. He measured off another thousand; it was now a river which I could not cross; the stream had swollen and was now deep water, a river impossible to cross. He then said, ‘Do you see, son of man?’ He took me further, then brought me back to the bank of the river. When I got back, there were many trees on each bank of the river. He said, ‘This water flows east down to the Arabah and to the sea; and flowing into the sea it makes its waters wholesome. Wherever the river flows, all living creatures teeming in it will live. Fish will be very plentiful, for wherever the water goes it brings health, and life teems wherever the river flows. Along the river, on either bank, will grow every kind of fruit tree with leaves that never wither and fruit that never fails; they will bear new fruit every month, because this water comes from the sanctuary. And their fruit will be good to eat and the leaves medicinal.’&amp;quot; – Ezekiel 47:1-9. 12, which is today&apos;s First Reading at Mass.

The sculptures, which are in alabaster, represent — Christ&apos;s Entry into Jerusalem; Washing the Disciples&apos; feet; the Last Supper; the Agony in the Garden; Bearing the Cross. Shafts of alabaster, round which a spiral belt is twisted, inlaid with agates and crystals on a gold ground, divide these compartments, and support the arches above. The tabernacle-work is crowded with figures of angels bearing the instruments of the Passion, and with medallion heads in relief: those on the north represent Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel; those south, the four Doctors of the Latin Church — Jerome, Ambrose, Augustine, and Gregory. Each compartment terminates in a gable, of which that in the centre is highest. In this gable is the Saviour, with Moses and Elias on either side; above is a medallion of the Annunciation; and on the highest point a figure of our Lord in Majesty. On the side gables are figures of the four Evangelists, with their emblems on the crockets. In trefoils, set in the gables, are projecting busts; those north representing Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James; those south St. John the Baptist and St. John the Divine. On p206spiral pillars between the gables are figures of Faith, Hope, and Charity, north; and of Justice, Prudence, and Fortitude, south. All the details of this very important work of modern [Victorian] art — in which the spirit rather than the letter of ancient examples has been followed — deserve the most careful observation. Much gold and colour has been applied to the figures, and to other portions of the sculpture.&amp;quot;</field> <field name="id">398654456</field> <field name="location">0,0</field><field name="license">2</field><field name="nbComments">3</field><field name="rank">293</field><field name="tags">elycathedral</field><field name="title">Ely Cathedral reredos</field><field name="url_b">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/170/398654456_ebf25368a9_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">Lawrence OP</field><field name="poi">angel of the north</field><field name="date_taken">2008-02-09T14:19:50Z</field><field name="description">Mosaic in the chapel of St Augustine at Westminster Cathedral, with the cardinal&apos;s hat of Basil Hume in the forefront. The image illustrates the following story: In 6th-century Rome, Pope Gregory one day sees a band of captives led to the market for sale. They are tall and fair-skinned and, what strikes Gregory&apos;s eye most particularly, blond. Moved with pity and curiosity he asks who they are and where they have come from. &amp;quot;They are Angles,&amp;quot; comes the reply. &amp;quot;Not Angles but angels,&amp;quot; says Gregory. He determines to send missionaries to the lands of the north, the most prominent among them the Benedictine monk, Augustine, later known as St Augustine of Canterbury. When Augustine arrives among the pagans of Anglia and Kent he writes a letter to Gregory, asking him what he ought to do about pagan shrines (where human sacrifices may have been performed). Gregory&apos;s letter (preserved in Bede&apos;s history) would provide the template for Christian missionary work ever after. Do not tear down those shrines, he said; but cleanse them. In other words, Gregory saw that all people have a natural intuition of God, and that therefore the object of the Christian missionary is to do what Paul attempted for the Athenians in Acts and to lead them from the natural light of religious reasoning to the supernatural revealed light of faith in Christ. 27 May is the feast of St Augustine of Canterbury.</field> <field name="id">2526804633</field> <field name="location">0,0</field><field name="license">2</field><field name="nbComments">1</field><field name="rank">294</field><field name="tags">london westminster cathedral mosaic staugustine stgregorythegreat</field><field name="title">St Gregory sends St Augustine to England</field><field name="url_b">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2256/2526804633_e32497b446_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">Lawrence OP</field><field name="poi">angel of the north</field><field name="date_taken">2009-12-13T17:14:17Z</field><field name="description">&amp;quot;Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, &amp;quot;Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!&amp;quot; And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all therein, saying, &amp;quot;To him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might for ever and ever!&amp;quot; And the four living creatures said, &amp;quot;Amen!&amp;quot; and the elders fell down and worshipped.&amp;quot; - Revelation 5:11-14.
