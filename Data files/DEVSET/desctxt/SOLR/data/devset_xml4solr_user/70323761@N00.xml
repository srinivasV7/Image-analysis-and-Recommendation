Although there are many others, the significance of the Acropolis of Athens is such that it is commonly known as The Acropolis without qualification. A flat-topped rock rising 150 m (512 ft) above sea level from the plain of Attica with steep cliffs on three sides, it was also known as Cecropia, after the legendary serpent-man, Kekrops or Cecrops, the first Athenian king. The first habitation remains date from the Neolithic period. Over the centuries, the &amp;quot;Sacred Rock&amp;quot; of Athens was used either as a cult place or as a residential area or both. The inscriptions on the numerous and precious offerings to the sanctuary of Athena indicate that the cult of the city&apos;s patron goddess was established as early as the Archaic period (650-480 B.C.). During the Classical period (450-330 B.C.) three important temples were erected on the ruins of earlier ones: &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135115501&quot;&gt;the Parthenon&lt;a&gt;, &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135114844&quot;&gt;the Erechtheion&lt;a&gt;, and &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135116270&quot;&gt;the Temple of Athena Nike&lt;a&gt;, dedicated to Athena Parthenos, Athena Polias, and Athena-Apteros Nike, respectively. &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135115675&quot;&gt;The Propylaea&lt;a&gt;, the monumental entrance to the sacred area was also constructed in the same period. The monuments on the Acropolis reflect the successive phases of the city&apos;s history. Some were converted into Christian churches, houses of the Franks and later on, of the Turks. After the liberation of Athens from the Turks, the protection, restoration and conservation of the monuments was one of the first tasks of the newly-founded Greek state. This major effort is continued until today, with the large-scale restoration and supporting of the monuments, which started in the 1970&apos;s and is still in progress. The first excavations on the hill were conducted between 1835 and 1837. More systematic work was carried out in 1885-1890 by Panagiotis Kavvadias. Accessible by foot only to the west, where it is linked by a low ridge to the hill of the Areopagus, the Acroplois is formed by a layer of blue-grey limestone, which is very hard but water-permeable. This rests on a layer of schist-sandstone marl, softer than the limestone but water-impermeable, leading to the ready formation of artesian springs, as well as sheltered caves at the hill&apos;s feet, which was attracted human habitation on and around the rock.</field> <field name="id">135116324</field> <field name="location">37.969558,23.732839</field><field name="license">3</field><field name="nbComments">0</field><field name="rank">160</field><field name="tags">ruins europe hellas athens unescoworldheritagesite unesco worldheritagesite greece acropolis mythology unescoworldheritage greekmythology worldheritage ancientgreece Αθήνα templeofolympianzeus Ελλάδα Ελλάς hellenicrepublic Παρθενών</field><field name="title">Athens: Acropolis - View from Olympic Temple of Zeus</field><field name="url_b">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/46/135116324_f739e8637b_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">wallyg</field><field name="poi">acropolis athens</field><field name="date_taken">2005-09-09T05:24:01Z</field><field name="description">The Parthenon (ancient Greek: Παρθενών) was a temple of Athena, built in the 5th century BC on the Acropolis of Athens. n octostyle, peripteral Doric temple with Ionic architectural features, it is the most famous surviving building of ancient Greece, and has been praised as the finest achievement of Greek architecture and one of the world&apos;s greatest cultural monuments. The Parthenon was built at the initiative of &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135117025&quot;&gt;Pericles&lt;a&gt; under the general supervision of the sculptor Phidias, who also had charge of the sculptural decoration. The architects were Iktinos and Kallikrates. Construction began in 447 BC, and the building was substantially completed by 438 BC, when the chryselephantine gold and ivory statue of Athena Parthenos, from which the name is derived, was sculpted by Pheidias and dedicated and the decoration of the Doric metopes on the frieze above the exterior colonnade, and of the Ionic frieze around the upper portion of the walls of the cella were completed. Modest construction continued until the beginning of the Peloponnesian War in 432 BC. Some of the financial accounts for the Parthenon survive and show that the largest single expense was transporting the stone from Mount Pentelicus, about 16 kilometers from Athens, to the Acropolis. The funds were partly drawn from the treasury of the Delian League, which was moved from the Panhellenic sanctuary at Delos to the Acropolis in 454 BC. In the 6th century AD the Parthenon was converted into a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin; after the Turkish conquest, it was converted into a mosque. In 1687 AD, a Turkish ammunition dump inside the building was ignited by a Venetian cannonball; the resulting explosion severely damaged the Parthenon and its sculptures. In the 19th century AD, Lord Elgin removed some of the surviving sculptures and took them to England. These sculptures, now known as the Elgin Marbles or Parthenon Marbles, are on display in the British Museum. An ongoing dispute concerns whether the Elgin Marbles should be returned to Greece. Measured at the top step, the dimensions of the base of the Parthenon are 69.5 meters by 30.9 meters (228.0 x 101.4 ft). The cella was 29.8 meters long by 19.2 meters wide (97.8 x 63.0 ft), with internal Doric colonnades in two tiers, structurally necessary to support the roof. On the exterior, the Doric columns measure 1.9 meters (6.2 ft) in diameter and are 10.4 meters (34.1 ft) high. The corner columns are slightly larger in diameter. The stylobate, the platform on which the columns stand, has an upward curvature towards its center of 60 millimeters (2.36 in) on the east and west ends, and of 110 millimeters (4.33 in) on the sides. Entasis refers to the slight swelling of the columns as they rise, to counter the optical effect of looking up at the temple. The effect of these subtle curves is to make the temple appear more symmetrical than it actually is. Some of the dimensions form the golden rectangle expressing the golden ratio, praised by Pythagoras in the previous century. The roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known as imbrices and tegulae. The ninety-two metopes were carved in high relief, a practice employed until then only in treasuries. Their design is attributed to the sculptor Kalamis. The metopes of the east side of the Parthenon, above the main entrance, depict the Gigantomachy . The metopes of the west end show Amazonomachy. The metopes of the south side (pictured here) (with the exception of the somewhat problematic metopes 13-20, now lost) show the Thessalian Centauromachy (battle of the Lapiths aided by Theseus against the half-man, half-horse Centaurs). On the north side of the Parthenon the metopes are poorly preserved, but the subject seems to be the sack of Troy. The most characteristic feature in the architecture and decoration of the temple is the Ionic frieze running around the exterior walls of the cella. Carved in bas-relief, it most likely depicts an idealized version of the Panathenaic procession from the Dipylon Gate in the Kerameikos to the Acropolis. In this procession held every 4 years, Athenians and foreigners were participating to honour the goddess Athena offering sacrifices and a new peplos (dress woven by selected noble Athenian girls called ergastines). The entire frieze was carved in situ and it is dated in 442-438 BC. The richness of the Parthenon&apos;s decoration is unique for a classical Greek temple. It is, however, in agreement with the function of the temple as a Treasury. In the opisthodomus (the back room of the cella) were stored the monetary contributions of the Delian Alliance of which Athens was the leading member. </field> <field name="id">288044415</field> <field name="location">37.971436,23.726209</field><field name="license">3</field><field name="nbComments">2</field><field name="rank">166</field><field name="tags">ruins europe hellas athens unescoworldheritagesite unesco worldheritagesite parthenon greece acropolis unescoworldheritage worldheritage ancientgreece centaur αθήνα erechteion theseus ελλάδα metope ελλάσ hellenicrepublic παρθενών thessaliancentauromachy</field><field name="title">Athens - Acropolis: Parthenon - SW corner metope</field><field name="url_b">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/101/288044415_2f81bbf54d_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">wallyg</field><field name="poi">acropolis athens</field><field name="date_taken">2005-09-09T05:26:05Z</field><field name="description">The Parthenon (ancient Greek: Παρθενών) was a temple of Athena, built in the 5th century BC on the &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135116398&quot;&gt;Acropolis of Athens&lt;a&gt;.

In this procession held every 4 years, Athenians and foreigners were participating to honour the goddess Athena offering sacrifices and a new peplos (dress woven by selected noble Athenian girls called ergastines). The entire frieze was carved in situ and it is dated in 442-438 BC. The richness of the Parthenon&apos;s decoration is unique for a classical Greek temple. It is, however, in agreement with the function of the temple as a Treasury. In the opisthodomus (the back room of the cella) were stored the monetary contributions of the Delian Alliance of which Athens was the leading member. </field> <field name="id">135115317</field> <field name="location">37.971436,23.726209</field><field name="license">3</field><field name="nbComments">2</field><field name="rank">216</field><field name="tags">ruins europe hellas athens unescoworldheritagesite unesco worldheritagesite parthenon greece acropolis mythology unescoworldheritage pediment greekmythology worldheritage ancientgreece αθήνα myflickr ελλάδα ελλάσ hellenicrepublic παρθενών</field><field name="title">Athens - Acropolis: Parthenon - West Pediment</field><field name="url_b">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/48/135115317_e43ee58560_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">wallyg</field><field name="poi">acropolis athens</field><field name="date_taken">2005-09-09T04:14:00Z</field><field name="description">As viewed from &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135119634&quot;&gt;the Pnyx&lt;a&gt;, the Acropolis of Athens is the best known acropolis (high city) in Greece. Although there are many others, the significance of the Acropolis of Athens is such that it is commonly known as The Acropolis without qualification. A flat-topped rock rising 150 m (512 ft) above sea level from the plain of Attica with steep cliffs on three sides, it was also known as Cecropia, after the legendary serpent-man, Kekrops or Cecrops, the first Athenian king. The first habitation remains date from the Neolithic period. Over the centuries, the &amp;quot;Sacred Rock&amp;quot; of Athens was used either as a cult place or as a residential area or both. The inscriptions on the numerous and precious offerings to the sanctuary of Athena indicate that the cult of the city&apos;s patron goddess was established as early as the Archaic period (650-480 B.C.). During the Classical period (450-330 B.C.) three important temples were erected on the ruins of earlier ones: &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135115501&quot;&gt;the Parthenon&lt;a&gt;, &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135114844&quot;&gt;the Erechtheion&lt;a&gt;, and &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135116270&quot;&gt;the Temple of Athena Nike&lt;a&gt;, dedicated to Athena Parthenos, Athena Polias, and Athena-Apteros Nike, respectively. &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135115675&quot;&gt;The Propylaea&lt;a&gt;, the monumental entrance to the sacred area was also constructed in the same period. The monuments on the Acropolis reflect the successive phases of the city&apos;s history. Some were converted into Christian churches, houses of the Franks and later on, of the Turks. After the liberation of Athens from the Turks, the protection, restoration and conservation of the monuments was one of the first tasks of the newly-founded Greek state. This major effort is continued until today, with the large-scale restoration and supporting of the monuments, which started in the 1970&apos;s and is still in progress. The first excavations on the hill were conducted between 1835 and 1837. More systematic work was carried out in 1885-1890 by Panagiotis Kavvadias. Accessible by foot only to the west, where it is linked by a low ridge to the hill of the Areopagus, the Acroplois is formed by a layer of blue-grey limestone, which is very hard but water-permeable. This rests on a layer of schist-sandstone marl, softer than the limestone but water-impermeable, leading to the ready formation of artesian springs, as well as sheltered caves at the hill&apos;s feet, which was attracted human habitation on and around the rock.</field> <field name="id">135116398</field> <field name="location">37.972641,23.718693</field><field name="license">3</field><field name="nbComments">4</field><field name="rank">236</field><field name="tags">ruins europe hellas athens unescoworldheritagesite unesco worldheritagesite parthenon greece acropolis mythology unescoworldheritage greekmythology worldheritage ancientgreece αθήνα pnyx ελλάδα ελλάσ hellenicrepublic παρθενών pnyxhill πνυξ πνύκα</field><field name="title">Athens: View of the Acropolis from the Pnyx</field><field name="url_b">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/53/135116398_f80942f44f_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">wallyg</field><field name="poi">acropolis athens</field><field name="date_taken">2005-09-09T05:21:16Z</field><field name="description">The Theatre of Dionysus was a major theatre in ancient Greece, cut into the southern cliff of the &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135116398&quot;&gt;Athenian Acropolis&lt;a&gt;. Serving as the birthplace of the Greek tragedy, the works of the great ancient dramatists Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes were first performed at this location during the 5th century BC. Precipitated by the collapse of wooden bleachers in the Agora, where dramatic and musical competitions were held up until the late sixth century BC, the Athenians chose chose this location since it was next to the shrine of Dionysus, the god of plays and wine.

Sometime in the 5th century during the time of Pericles and the tragedians, a wooden skene (stage area) was added. In the 430&apos;s Alkamenes made a chyselephantine cult statue of Dionysus for his temple. Walls were built to support the east and west sides of the theater and a stoa was connected to the wooden set. The theater that has survived to our time was designed between 342 and 326 BC, when the archon Lycurgus commissioned an extensive reconstruction in stone and marble. Lycurgus expanded the number of seats to 17,000 (Plato suggests 30,000 in the Symposium). Of the 64 tiers, about 20 survive. A diazoma (division between upper and lower seats) was added also. At this time, the wooden seats were replaced with the Piraeus limestone that survives. The design of the seats allows a 13-inch trough in which spectators can rest their feet without discomfiting those in the row below. Lycurgus also replaced the portable, wooden sets with a permanent stone skene, complete with side-entryways (paraskenia) and paths (paradoi), built a new Temple of Dionysus for the Alkamenes&apos; statue, and added a row of 67 high-backed chairs of Pendelic marble for judges and dignitaries. Each seat is inscribed with the name of the individual for whom it was reserved. The elaborately carved throne in the center of the first row belonged to the Priest of Dionysus - who officiated over the event - and lies in direct line with the thymele, or altar of the god, in the center of the orchestra. The throne of Hadrian sat on the stone plinth immediately behind the priest. This other remarkably preserved throne is of unknown ownership but sports the same elaborately carved lion-claw feet as the one belonging to the Priest of Dionysus. The Hellenistic Era didn&apos;t see too many changes, but in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, a raised stage with a stone proskenion was added, as well as a second story for the skene. The Roman Era saw some major changes to the structure, such as a marble barrier to protect the audience during gladiatorial exhibitions (AD 1st). Like most Greek structures of civic importance, the Romans rededicated the theater, in this instance in the names of Dionysus and the Emperor Nero. The Bema of Phaedrus has been dated to the 2nd century AD: the ophot on the left would have been the front of the Roman stage, and the reliefs depict stories from the life of Dionysus. In the 4th century AD, Romans put down the marble slabs that survive today in the orchestra to make it watertight so that they could perform naumachia (brutal sea battles in which gladiators in boats hacked at each other). </field> <field name="id">135116101</field> <field name="location">37.970311,23.727732</field><field name="license">3</field><field name="nbComments">5</field><field name="rank">272</field><field name="tags">ruins europe theater theatre hellas athens unescoworldheritagesite unesco worldheritagesite greece acropolis unescoworldheritage worldheritage ancientgreece Αθήνα dionysis Ελλάδα Ελλάς hellenicrepublic theatreofdionysis</field><field name="title">Athens - Acropolis: Theatre of Dionysis</field><field name="url_b">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/46/135116101_b242553435_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">wallyg</field><field name="poi">acropolis athens</field><field name="date_taken">2005-09-09T04:45:20Z</field><field name="description">The Theatre of Dionysus was a major theatre in ancient Greece, cut into the southern cliff of the &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135116398&quot;&gt;Athenian Acropolis&lt;a&gt;.

It is said to be where Poseidon left his trident marks in the rock, and Athena&apos;s olive tree sprouted, in their battle for possession of the city. Named after Erechtheus, one of the mythical kings of Athens, the temple was a sanctuary to both Athena Polias, and Erechtheus-Poseidon. Construction took many years, being halted during the brief respite of the Peloponnesian War referred to as the Peace of Nikias, and resuming in 410 BC. Best estimates have completion around 395 BC. It has been used for a range of purposes including a harem for the wives of the Turkish disdar in 1463. It was completely destroyed by a Turkish shell in 1827 during the War of Independence causing hated disputes over restoration. The Erectheum has three main parts: the main section of the temple, the north porch, and the &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg288042756&quot;&gt;Porch of Caryatids&lt;a&gt;. The main section is divided into an &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135114844&quot;&gt;eastern&lt;a&gt; and a western cella. The western cella housed altars to Poseidon, Butes and Hephaestus and a snake pit dedicated to the chthonic gods. A 32 foot beam ran across its length (cuttings for supporting struts are still visible) rosettes decorated the walls. The ledge above the door to the Caryatid porch held Kammimachos&apos; famous gold palm-tree lamp. In front of the western cella sit Athena&apos;s olive tree and the pre-invasion terrace wall of the old temple. Pausanias perpetuates the myth that the day after the Persians burned the Acropolis in 480 BC, the tree produced a new shoot four feet long. Tradition has it that this tree traces its roots back to the tree Athena originally planed in her bid for Attica. Although the tree was cut down by numerous invaders from Sulla in 86 BC to the Turks in 1456, each time a sprig was saved and replanted. The last replanting was made in 1952 by the American School, who saved it after the Germans cut it down during the 1942 occupation. The columns of the North Porch sport a guillache pattern and held glass inserts of four colors. A hole in the floor allows one to see the marks of Poseidon&apos;s trident, and an open space in the ceiling allows Poseidon to re-hurl his trident, should he wish. Although certainly remarkable, this three-pronged mark in the rock is not the site of the salt water well that Poseidon caused to be by striking the ground with his trident. That long-lost well would have been just inside the north door to the cella. Near the north porch of the Erechtheum is the grave of Erechtheus, mythical king of Athens. The South Porch is commonly called the Caryatid Porch. The women are caught midstride, with the three on the left sporting bent left knees and the remaining bent right. The identity of the Caryatids is unknown. Theories range from criminals forced to bear a heavy burden to the Arrephoroi chosen to deliver the peplos to Athena to young initiates of Artemis at Brauron to upper-class Athenian women. The southwest corner of the porch lies atop the Grave of Cecrops, so they could be his defenders. The ceiling coffers of the Caraytid Porch are almost entirely intact.

Though not built as a fortified structure, it was important that people not ritually clean, runaway slaves and other miscreats be denied access to the sanctuary where they could claim protection of the gods. The state treasury was also kept on the Acropolis, making its security important. Propylaea, Propylea or Propylaia (Greek: Προπυλαια) became the term given to all monumental gateways. The word propylaea is the union of the prefix pro (before or in front of) plus the plural of the Greek pylon or pylaion (gate), meaning literally that which is before the gates, but the word has come to mean simply gate building. Built under the general direction of the Athenian leader &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135117025&quot;&gt;Pericles&lt;a&gt;, Phidias was given the responsibility for planning the rebuilding the Acropolis as a whole at the conclusion of the Persian Wars. Designed by the architect Mnesicles, construction began in 437 BCE and was terminated in 431, when as a result of the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta, the building was left unfinished. The Propylaeum survived intact through the Greek, Roman and Byzantine periods. During the period of Latin Empire, it served as the palace of the de la Roche family, who held the title Duke of Athens from 1204 to 1311. It was severely damaged by an explosion of a powder magazine in 1656. A tower of French or Ottoman date, erected on the south wing, was pulled down in 1874. The Propylaeum was constructed of white Pentelic marble, gray Eleusinian marble or limestone (for accents), and structural iron. The structure consists of a one to the north and one to the south. The core is the central building, which presents a standard six-columned Doric façade both on the West to those entering the Acropolis and on the east to those departing. The columns echo the proportions (not the size) of the columns of &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135115317&quot;&gt;the Parthenon&lt;a&gt;. The central building contains the gate wall, about two-thirds of the way through it. There are five gates in the wall, one for the central passageway, which was not paved and lay along the natural level of the ground, and two on either side at the level of the building. The central passageway was the culmination of the Sacred Way, which led to the Acropolis from Eleusis. The gate wall and the eastern (inner) portion of the building sit at a level five steps above the western portion, and the roof of the central building rose on the same line. The ceiling in the eastern part of the central building was famous in antiquity, having been called by Pausanias (about 600 years after the building was finished) &amp;quot;…down to the present day unrivalled.&amp;quot; It consisted of marble blocks carved in the shape of ceiling coffers and painted blue with gold stars. The wings to the right and left of the central building stood on the same platform as the central building but were much smaller, not only in plan but in scale. Like the central building, the wings use Doric colonnades and Doric entablatures. However, the central building also has an Ionic colonnade on either side of the central passageway between the western (outer) Doric colonnade and the gate wall. This is therefore the first building known to us with Doric and Ionic colonnades visible at the same time. It is also the first monumental building in the classical period to be more complex than a simple rectangle or cylinder. The wing on the north (to the left as one enters the Acropolis) was famous in antiquity as the location of paintings of important Greek battles. Pausanias reports their presence, but few scholars believe the room was planned to hold them. Recent scholarship, has taken the northern wing to have been a room for ritual dining. The evidence for that is the off-center doorway and the position near the entrance to the Acropolis. The wing on the south, though much smaller, was designed to appear to be symmetrical. It seems only to have functioned as an access route to the &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135116270&quot;&gt;Temple of Athena Nike&lt;a&gt;</field> <field name="id">135115675</field> <field name="location">37.972007,23.724712</field><field name="license">3</field><field name="nbComments">2</field><field name="rank">281</field><field name="tags">ruins europe entrance hellas athens unescoworldheritagesite unesco worldheritagesite greece acropolis mythology unescoworldheritage greekmythology worldheritage ancientgreece Αθήνα propylaia propylea Ελλάδα propylaea propylaeum Ελλάς hellenicrepublic Προπυλαια classicalperiod</field><field name="title">Athens - Acropolis: North Wing of the Propylaeum</field><field name="url_b">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/51/135115675_4249687869_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">wallyg</field><field name="poi">acropolis athens</field><field name="date_taken">2005-09-08T16:12:40Z</field><field name="description">The Temple of Athena Nike, on the Nike Bastion of the &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg135116398&quot;&gt;Acropolis&lt;a&gt;, was constructed in ca. 420 B.C. by the architect Kallikrates. It is built in the Ionic order, and it is amphiprostyle with a row of four columns in front and behind the narrow main cella. Inside the cella would have stood the cult statue of Athena holding a helment in one hand and a pomegranate (symbol of fertility) in the other). The Turks dismantled the temple in 1686, and it has been reassembled twice since then. The relief frieze on the upper section of the walls depicts the conference of gods on the east side, and scenes from the Battle of Plataea, the victory of the Greeks over the Persians in 479 B.C., on the other. Four of the original 14 slabs are now on display in the British Museum. A marble parapet decorated with the relief representation of Nikae (Victories), protected the edge of the Bastion on which the temple was erected.

It forms the practical part of a national memorial to the Prince Consort - the decorative part is the &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg298037756&quot;&gt;Albert Memorial&lt;a&gt; directly to the north. The hall also accommodates the largest pipe organ in the UK, and is the home of The Proms. The Hall, affectionately titled &amp;quot;The Nation&apos;s Village Hall&amp;quot;, hosts the Proms every summer since they were bombed out of the Queen&apos;s Hall in 1941, used for classical and rock concerts, conferences, ballroom dancing, poetry recitals, education, ballet, opera and even a circus (Cirque du Soleil). It has hosted many sporting events, including boxing, wrestling (including the first Sumo wrestling tournament ever to be held outside Japan) and tennis. It also hosts the annual Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance, held the day before Remembrance Sunday. The hall, a Grade I listed building, is oval in shape, measuring 83 m (272 feet) by 72 m (238 feet) around the outside, and has a capacity of 8,000 people and has accommodated as many as 9,000 (safety restrictions now allow a maximum capacity of 5,544 including standing in the Gallery). The great glass and wrought-iron dome roofing the hall is 41 m (135 feet) high. Around the outside of the hall is a great terra cotta frieze, depicting &amp;quot;The Triumph of Arts and Sciences&amp;quot;, in reference to the hall&apos;s dedication. One-foot high letters above the frieze have the Biblical quotations: &amp;quot;Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is - in the heaven and in the earth is Thine. ... The wise and their works are in the hand of God. ... Glory be to God on high, and on earth peace.&amp;quot; The Hall was designed by Captain Francis Fowke and Colonel H.Y. Darracott Scott of the Royal Engineers. They were heavily influenced by ancient amphitheatres, but had also been exposed to the ideas of Gottfried Semper. The Hall was constructed mainly of Fareham Red brick, with terra cotta block decoration made by Gibbs and Canning Ltd. of Tamworth. The dome, designed by Rowland Mason Ordish,was made of steel and glazed. There was a trial assembly made of the steel framework of the dome in Manchester, then it was taken apart again and transported down to London via horse and cart. When the time came for the supporting structure to be removed, only volunteers remained on site in case the structure dropped. It did drop - but only by 58&amp;quot;. In 1851 the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, led Prince Albert, the Prince Consort, to propose that a permanent series of facilities be built in the area for the enlightenment of the public. Progress on the scheme was slow and in 1861 Prince Albert died, without having seen his ideas come to fruition. However, a memorial was proposed for Hyde Park, with a Great Hall opposite. In April 1867 Queen Victoria signed the Royal Charter and in May, laid the foundation stone. The official opening ceremony of the Royal Albert Hall was on March 29, 1871. After a welcoming speech by Edward, the Prince of Wales, Queen Victoria was too overcome to speak, so the Prince had to announce that &amp;quot;The Queen declares this Hall is now open&amp;quot;. A concert followed, when the Hall&apos;s acoustic problems became immediately apparent. These were addressed in 1969 when a series of large fibreglass acoustic diffusing discs (commonly referred to as &amp;quot;mushrooms&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;flying saucers&amp;quot;) were installed in the roof to cut down echo. Initially lit by gas, electric lighting was installed in 1897. In 1936, the hall was the scene of a giant rally celebrating the British Empire, the occasion being the centenary of Joseph Chamberlain&apos;s birth. The hall is primarily used as a live music venue. Some famous concerts include the only bill to feature both the Beatles and The Rolling Stones in 1963, Cream&apos;s farewell show, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Andrew Lloyd Weber&apos;s 50th birthday celebration, and the Les Miserables &amp;quot;Dream Cast&amp;quot; 10th Anniversary performance. One that it didn&apos;t hold was Bob Dylan&apos;s widely bootlegged May 17, 1966 concert, mistakingly labeled as being in Royal Albert Hall. In fact, this concert was at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester. Dylan did close that tour later that month at the Hall, though.</field> <field name="id">298346556</field> <field name="location">51.501356,-0.177626</field><field name="license">3</field><field name="nbComments">3</field><field name="rank">193</field><field name="tags">uk greatbritain england westminster hall royalalberthall memorial europe unitedkingdom britain kensington princealbert concerthall southkensington londonist englishheritage gradei musicvenue kensingtonchelsea albertopolis gradeilisted royalalberthallofartsandsciences thenationsvillagehall</field><field name="title">UK - London - South Kensington: Royal Albert Hall</field><field name="url_b">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/110/298346556_beeefd320e_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">wallyg</field><field name="poi">albert memorial</field><field name="date_taken">2006-11-09T05:52:17Z</field><field name="description">The Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences (originally to have been called The Central Hall of Arts and Sciences but changed by Queen Victoria when laying the foundation stone at the very last minute) is an arts venue dedicated to Queen Victoria&apos;s husband and consort, Prince Albert.

The memorial was authorized by Congress on January 11, 1927 and responsibility for the installation of the memorial was placed with the Albert Gallatin Memorial Fund Commission. By 1934 enough funds had been raised, but the memorial was delayed by the U.S. Fine Arts Commission&apos;s approval of a suitable model. By the time the model was ready to be cast, WWII had created a ban on the non-war use of bronze. Before installation in the north courtyard, a fountain had to be removed. Albert Gallatin (1761-1849) arrived in Cape Ann, Massachusetts in 1780 from his native Switzerland and later settled in Pennsylvania where he was elected a member of the State Legislature. He went on to be elected to the U.S. Senate and later the House of Representatives where he served on the new Standing Committee of Finance. Gallatin&apos;s interest in the fiscal operation of the U.S. Government led President Jefferson to offer him the post of Secretary of the Treasury in 1801. Within six years, Gallatin was not only able to see that the U.S. debt of fourteen million dollars was paid off, but also that a surplus of funds was created. Gallatin was again offered the position of Secretary of the Treasury in 1916 by President Madison and in 1843 by President Tyler, but declined. He went on to negotiate the Treaty of Ghent ending the War of 1812, and serve as Minister both to France and to England before retiring from government service. He then moved to New York where he became the president of the National Bank of the City of New York. He later became a founder of New York University and the American Ethnological Society. The United States Department of the Treasury Building, at 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, is the third oldest building in Washington, dating from 1836. Robert Mills was commissioned to design the T-shaped Greek Revival building after the two previous structures had burned down. The Department of Treasury, established by an Act of U.S. Congress in 1789 to manage the revenue of the United States government, prints and mints all paper currency and coins in circulation through the &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg3642167963&quot;&gt;Bureau of Engraving&lt;a&gt; and Printing and the &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg2564490354&quot;&gt;United States Mint&lt;a&gt;. Alexander Hamilton, of whom &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg3643080789&quot;&gt;a statue stands on the south wing&lt;a&gt;, was sworn in as the first Secretary of the Treasury on September 11, 1789. The Department of Treasury moved into a porticoed Gregorian-style building, designed by George Hadfield in 1800 when the federal government moved from Philadelphia. The structure was destroyed by the British in 1814, but rebuilt by James Hobson. It was again burned, this time by arsonists in 1833, with only the fireproof wing left standing. Three years later, on July 4, 1836, Congress authorized construction of a new East and Center Wings. The most architecturally impressive feature of the Mills design is the 341-foot long colonnade of thirty 36-foot tall columns carved out of a single block of granite. The material for the original Wing was Acquia Creek freestone, which was largely replaced with granite in 1908. The interior design of the east and center wings is classically austere, in keeping with the Greek Revival style. In 1855, Congress granted authority to extend the building. Construction of what is now the &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg3643887436&quot;&gt;South Wing&lt;a&gt; was begun in July 1855 and completed and occupied in September 1861. Construction started on the west wing in 1855 and was completed and occupied in 1864. The preliminary design of the wings was provided by Thomas Ustick Walter, but construction began under the supervision of Ammi B. Young and from 1862 until 1867 by Isaiah Rogers. While the exterior of the building was executed along the lines of the original Mills wings, the interiors of the later wings reflect changes in both building technology and aesthetic tastes. Iron columns and beams reinforced the building&apos;s brick vaults, and the architectural detailing became much more ornate, following mid-nineteenth century fashion. The final addition came in 1867 in the form of the North Wing, which displaced the Department of State Building. Designed by Alfred B. Mullett, the wing contains the Cash Room, opened in 1869 as the site of Ulysses S. Grant&apos;s Inaugural Ball. It is a two-story marble hall in which the daily financial business was transacted. The Attic story, now the Treasury Building&apos;s fifth floor, was added in 1910. A statue of Albert Gallatin, the 4th and longest serving Secretary, sits on the North Patio. Lafayette Square Historic District, roughly bordered by 15th and 17th Sts. and H St. and State and Treasury Places, exclusive of the White House and its grounds, covers the seven-acre public park, Lafayette Square, and its surrounding structures including the Executive Office Building, Blair House, the Treasury Building, the Decatur House, and St. John&apos;s Episcopal Church.

A memorial to William&apos;s father, John Jacob Astor, the portal was designed by Richard Morris Hunt. Karl Bitter was selected in a competition to sculpt the &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg5090559406&quot;&gt;doors at the front entrance&lt;a&gt;, with runners up Charles Henry Niehaus and John Massey Rhind commissioned to sculpt the north and south doors. Niehaus&apos;s twelve-foot bronze doors at the south entrance feature six demi-relief panels, each depicting a scene in the history of Manhattan and the Trinity Church: Hendrik Hudson on the Half moon Discovering Manhattan Island; Dr. Barclay Preaching to the Indians; Washington Entering St. Paul&apos;s Chapel after his Inauguration as President; The Consecration of Four Bishop&apos;s in St. Paul&apos;s Chapel; Consecration of Trinity Church; and The Dedication of the Astor Reredos. Trinity Church, prominently located at the terminus of Wall Street at 79 Broadway, is the oldest Episcopal church in New York City, having been consecrated on Ascension Day May 1, 1846. Designed by architect Richard Upjohn, Trinity is considered a classic example of Gothic Revival architecture. At the time of its completion, the 281-foot spire was the highest point in New York until being surpassed in 1890 by the New York World Building. The Trinity Church parish received its initial charter from King William III of England in 1697. The first Trinity Church building, a modest rectangular structure with a gambrel roof and small porch was constructed in 1698. The building was destroyed in the Great New York City Fire of 1776, in the early days of the military occupation by the British during the American Revolutionary War. Construction on the second building began in 1788, which was consecrated in 1790 and then torn down after being weakened by severe snows during the winter of 1838–39. By the early 1840&apos;s, the church&apos;s expanding parish had split. The newly formed parish would build Grace Church, to the north on Broadway at 10th street, while the original parish would re-build the Trinity that stands today. Upjohn designed the new Church in Neo-Gothic fashion, complete with sandstone and stained-glass windows--two features unheard of at the time. Adorned with Gothic spires and pointed arches, and sporting a very linear upward-appearing exterior, the design reflected &amp;quot;High Church&amp;quot; fashion, at odds with contemporary Protestant &amp;quot;Low Church&amp;quot; thought. As a compromise, the side walls were kept simple, without the flying buttresses predominant in most Gothic structures. The adjoining Trinity Churchyard Cemetery, opened in 1697, is one of three separate burial grounds that make up the non-denominational Trinity Church Cemetery (the others being the &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg152447742&quot;&gt;Churchyard of St. Paul&apos;s Chapel&lt;a&gt; and the Trinity Church Cemetery and Mausoleum at the Chapel of Intercession).

Above, sounding a trumpet and bearing a standard, winged Fame soars across a palm tree, an image evoking the Egyptian expedition. The scene illustrates the year 1810, the date of the apogee of Napoléon&apos;s reign, his marriage to Marie-Louise of Austria to assure the future of the dynasty, and conquests which expanded the Empire to the maximum. Cortot&apos;s Fame serves as pendant to &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg1427737925&quot;&gt;Rude&apos;s Genius of Liberty&lt;a&gt;. The Arc de Triomphe stands in the centre of the Place Charles de Gaulle, also known as the Place de l&apos;Étoile (Star Square). Designed by Jean Chalgrin between 1806 and 1836, the 51 meter high, 45-meter wide monument is the second largest triumphal arch in existence. It honors those who fought for France, particularly during the Napoleonic Wars. </field> <field name="id">1428450809</field> <field name="location">48.873832,2.295064</field><field name="license">3</field><field name="nbComments">1</field><field name="rank">22</field><field name="tags">sculpture paris france statue europe arc triomphe arcdetriomphedeletoile relief triumph napoleon arcdetriomphe napoléon placedelÉtoile placecharlesdegaulle highrelief placedeletoile arcdetriomphedelÉtoile starsquare letriomphede1810 jeanpierrecortot napoleonstriumph napoléonstriumph triomphedenapoléon triumphof1810 triomphedenapoleon</field><field name="title">Paris: Arc de Triomphe de l&apos;Étoile - Le Triomphe de 1810</field><field name="url_b">http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1098/1428450809_6a002a15eb_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">wallyg</field><field name="poi">arc de triomphe</field><field name="date_taken">2007-09-08T08:57:54Z</field><field name="description">The Arc de Triomphe, in the centre of the Place Charles de Gaulle, also known as the Place de l&apos;Étoile (Star Square), at the western end of &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg1429400056&quot;&gt;Avenue de Champs-Élysées&lt;a&gt;, honors those who fought for France, particularly during the Napoleonic Wars.

The sculptured high relief, executed by François Rude, represents the Genius of Liberty in the guise of a winged female emitting a cry of warning in the face of enemy invasion. She incites the people to battle by brandishing a sword. Beneath her, a bearded, breast-plated warrior leads along a naked youth by the shoulders, while waving his helmet to signal departure and unification. He seems indifferent to the advice apparently offered to him by a bearded old man in the background. To the right, carrying a shield and draped in a coat, another warrior readies himself to follow his companions. To the left, a stopping soldier braces himself, while behind, a man wearing a helmet sounds the trumpet. A last soldier reins in a whinnying horse by his bridle. Rude illustrates a basic event in Revolutionary history: the Conscription of 1792 which involved the levying of 200,000 men en masse under orders of the Legislative Assembly in order to organize the defense of France against foreign armies allied against the Revolutionaries. This massive conscription had secured the first victory of Revolution against a foreign power at the &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comphotoswallyg1444587485&quot;&gt;Battle of Valmy against Prussia&lt;a&gt; on September 20, 1792. Shortly thereafter, the Revolutionary armies won a battle against Austria at Jemmapes on November 6, 1792. Although Rude was celebrating the Conscription in memorial with this work, he did so in an allegorical manner. By employing neither costumes of the epoch nor contemporary Revolutionary arms, he presented a universal struggle of a people in defense of their territory. The face of the allegorical representation of France calling forth her people on this last was used as the belt buckle for the seven-star rank of Marshal of France. Famously it is said that her sword broke off on the day that the Battle of Verdun began in 1916. The relief was immediately hidden by tarpaulins to conceal the accident and avoid any ominous interpretations. The Arc de Triomphe stands in the centre of the Place Charles de Gaulle, also known as the Place de l&apos;Étoile (Star Square). Designed by Jean Chalgrin between 1806 and 1836, the 51 meter high, 45-meter wide monument is the second largest triumphal arch in existence.

The sculptured relief, executed by John Chaponnière, depicts General Jean Baptiste Kléber and his soldiers, reached the summits of the Alexandrian ramparts on July 3, 1798 as part of the Egyptian Campaign. Having suffered a Wounded to the head, Kléber is portrayed holding his right hand to his forehead and pointing to the enemy with the sword in his left. A French soldier pierces his bayonnet into the chest of a Turk who injured Kléber , while a nude Egyptian prepares to stab him. Behind Kléber, a solider rips his cartouche, as a second one mounts the last step which gives out onto the ramparts. To the left, one last soldier appeals to his companions.

Its balcony, which faces this large square, has famously served as a podium by many figures, including Eva Perón, who rallied the descamisados there, and Pope John Paul II, who visited Buenos Aires in 1998. Located at the east end of Plaza de Mayo, the Italian-style neoclassical building was built in phases, but dates back mostly to the late 19th century.

In 1857, President Justo José de Urquiza largely replaced the fort with Edward Taylor&apos;s La Aduana Nueva, a new Italianate-style Custom house, but its administrative annex survived to be used as the Presidential offices of Bartolomé Mitre in the 1860s. President Domingo Sarmiento gave the building its characteristic pink hue--reportedly to defuse political tensions by mixing the red and white colors of the opposing political parties.

The Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 damaged the structure, and twisted the dome four inches (102 mm) on its base.
