It is one of the greatest works of Roman architecture and engineering. Occupying a site just east of the Roman Forum, its construction started between 70 and 72 AD under the emperor Vespasian and was completed in 80 AD under Titus, with further modifications being made during Domitian&apos;s reign (81–96). The name &amp;quot;Amphitheatrum Flavium&amp;quot; derives from both Vespasian&apos;s and Titus&apos;s family name (Flavius, from the gens Flavia). Originally capable of seating around 50,000 spectators, the Colosseum was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles. It remained in use for nearly 500 years with the last recorded games being held there as late as the 6th century. As well as the traditional gladiatorial games, many other public spectacles were held there, such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The building eventually ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such varied purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry and a Christian shrine. &lt;a href&quot;http:bighugelabs.comflickronblack.php?id2362686268&amp;amp;sizelarge&quot;&gt;View On Black&lt;a&gt; &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comgroupsworldpooltagsitaly&quot;&gt;Back to Italy&lt;a&gt; - &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comgroupsworld&quot;&gt;Visit the World&lt;a&gt;</field> <field name="id">2362686268</field> <field name="location">41.88993,12.491943</field><field name="license">3</field><field name="nbComments">0</field><field name="rank">56</field><field name="tags">travel italy rome roma architecture canon europe italia interior colosseum coliseum lazio colosseo anfiteatro flavian flavianamphitheatre canonsd450 sd450 anfiteatroflavio flavior</field><field name="title">Colosseum II</field><field name="url_b">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3285/2362686268_70a22d4744_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">wenzday01</field><field name="poi">colosseum</field><field name="date_taken">2007-12-27T14:35:48Z</field><field name="description">From &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiColosseum&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;a&gt;: The Colosseum or Coliseum, originally the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, the largest ever built in the Roman Empire.

It is one of the greatest works of Roman architecture and engineering. Occupying a site just east of the Roman Forum, its construction started between 70 and 72 AD under the emperor Vespasian and was completed in 80 AD under Titus, with further modifications being made during Domitian&apos;s reign (81–96). The name &amp;quot;Amphitheatrum Flavium&amp;quot; derives from both Vespasian&apos;s and Titus&apos;s family name (Flavius, from the gens Flavia). Originally capable of seating around 50,000 spectators, the Colosseum was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles. It remained in use for nearly 500 years with the last recorded games being held there as late as the 6th century. As well as the traditional gladiatorial games, many other public spectacles were held there, such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The building eventually ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such varied purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry and a Christian shrine. &lt;a href&quot;http:bighugelabs.comflickronblack.php?id2354714589&amp;amp;sizelarge&quot;&gt;View On Black&lt;a&gt; &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comgroupsworldpooltagsitaly&quot;&gt;Back to Italy&lt;a&gt; - &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comgroupsworld&quot;&gt;Visit the World&lt;a&gt;</field> <field name="id">2354714589</field> <field name="location">41.890521,12.491492</field><field name="license">3</field><field name="nbComments">0</field><field name="rank">233</field><field name="tags">travel italy rome roma architecture canon europe italia exterior amphitheatre colosseum flavio coliseum lazio colosseo anfiteatro flavian flavianamphitheatre canonsd450 sd450 anfiteatroflavio</field><field name="title">Looking Up</field><field name="url_b">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3086/2354714589_76dcfb6160_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">wenzday01</field><field name="poi">colosseum</field><field name="date_taken">2007-12-27T15:39:12Z</field><field name="description">The late afternoon sun coming down through the Colosseum. &lt;a href&quot;http:bighugelabs.comflickronblack.php?id2374245666&amp;amp;sizelarge&quot;&gt;View On Black&lt;a&gt; &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comgroupsworldpooltagsitaly&quot;&gt;Back to Italy&lt;a&gt; - &lt;a href&quot;http:www.flickr.comgroupsworld&quot;&gt;Visit the World&lt;a&gt; *** For some reason, since March 28th, two days ago, all my photos of Rome have been geotagged to Vatican City, even though I&apos;m placing them right on the Colosseum on the map (also most zoomed in as I can get it). If you view the map, however, you&apos;ll see that the photo is placed in the correct place. I&apos;m not sure if this will get resolved anytime soon, but just wanted to make a note of it.</field> <field name="id">2374245666</field> <field name="location">41.889806,12.492973</field><field name="license">3</field><field name="nbComments">1</field><field name="rank">247</field><field name="tags">travel italy rome roma silhouette architecture contrast canon europe italia interior colosseum flavio coliseum lazio colosseo anfiteatro flavian flavianamphitheatre canonsd450 sd450 anfiteatroflavio</field><field name="title">Sunburst</field><field name="url_b">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2327/2374245666_fda3a15492_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">wenzday01</field><field name="poi">colosseum</field><field name="userid">42139271@N00</field></doc></add>
