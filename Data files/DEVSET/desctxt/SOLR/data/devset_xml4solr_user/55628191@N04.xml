It features a bareheaded soldier in uniform who stands on a pedestal with bowed head and arms reversed. It has been said that the soldier seems to be musing on those killed in the war. At his feet is a helmet. On the four sides of the pedestal are bronze plaques with the names of the dead. Those relating to the men killed in the second World War have Staffordshire knots at their bases.

A soldier on a plinth stands at ease with his rifle held in his right hand and his left hand clenched in a fist. He has a determined look on his face. This memorial was unveiled on the 7th May 1921 by Colonel John Ward DSO MP. The bronze plaques carry a good deal of detail and are shown in the gallery below. One carries details of the actual date of death and where that death occurred; something that is I think quite rare. The sculptor was Albert Toft.</field> <field name="id">5177841029</field> <field name="location">0,0</field><field name="license">1</field><field name="nbComments">0</field><field name="rank">284</field><field name="tags">alberttoft englishwarmemorials</field><field name="title">Sandon War Memorial</field><field name="url_b">http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1297/5177841029_bae301ed9f_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">Gordon T Lawson</field><field name="poi">albert memorial</field><field name="userid">55628191@N04</field></doc></add>
