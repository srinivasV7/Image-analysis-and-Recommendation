Peter and Mary). It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Construction began in 1248 but was halted in 1473, leaving it unfinished. Work recommenced in the 19th century and was completed, to the original plan, in 1880. The architectural style is Gothic. Photo shows the N side of the cathedral. Scaffolding is for renovations (apparently renovations are almost continuous). The cathedral is a huge landmark which can be seen from considerable distances. Being just across the square (&lt;i&gt;Bahnhofsvorplatz&lt;i&gt;) from the equally impressive &lt;a href&quot;http:flic.krpd9WWkV&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cologne Central Station (&lt;i&gt;Köln Hauptbahnhof&lt;i&gt;) &lt;a&gt;, and close to the huge steel Hohenzollern Bridge (&lt;i&gt;Hohenzollernbrücke&lt;i&gt;), this makes for a striking &lt;a href&quot;http:bit.lyTNrpU9&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;contrast&lt;a&gt; in styles, function and history of three huge structures.

Taken on our return rail journey at the end of our holiday. Today we left Bonn on a local train, and changed at Cologne (&lt;i&gt;Köln&lt;i&gt;) where we had a little bit of spare time. We then took an ICE train to Brussels (Bruxelles Midi), Belgium, where we changed to a Eurostar train for St.Pancras International, London. By coincidence, this gave me the chance to photograph (and contrast) the great arched canopies of different ages, of three famous railway stations all in one day - Cologne Central, Liège Guillemins and London St.Pancras. By another coincidence, we found we were due to cross paths at St.Pancras with some of the family on an outward trip to France. We had some time to spare between changing trains at Cologne (&lt;i&gt;Köln&lt;i&gt;) so we sat in the sun, using the Cathedral steps for our waiting room. &lt;b&gt;Photo&lt;b&gt; by Brian (upper), Jill (lower). © Darkroom Daze &lt;a href&quot;http:bit.ly47tbGf&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;a&gt;.

I have not yet been able to find out any useful historical or art details about any of the bronze doors of the Cathedral. Just guessing that they are 19th Century in Medieval style? The clothing of the figures and the musical instruments they are playing seem to be late Medieval - L-R: bagpipe, rattles, fiddle and a double trumpet, like a Medieval equivalent of a rock band, I guess. The lions don&apos;t look too happy. I guess the band was making too much of a racket, and perhaps the lions were contemplating eating the musicians for supper. &lt;b&gt;Photo&lt;b&gt; Brian © Darkroom Daze &lt;a href&quot;http:bit.ly47tbGf&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;a&gt;.

By another coincidence, we found we were due to cross paths at St.Pancras with some of the family on an outward trip to France. This station is an important rail hub for Germany and for this part of Europe. The main arched canopy is out of sight away to the L. This smaller canopy is relatively modern, built to cover platform extensions. In the distance is the massive &lt;i&gt;Hohenzollernbrücke&lt;i&gt; (Hohenzollern Bridge), which carries the main railway lines over the River Rhine. Remarkably, this station and bridge are adjacent to the huge medieval cathedral of Cologne (out of sight here, behind us) and make a striking contrast of styles, function and history. This view was taken from near the top of the cathedral steps, looking E at the SE end of the station. In the foreground is a high speed ICE train of Deutsche Bahn (German Railways) and the red train further away, partly on the bridge, is a local train. THE BRIDGE The &lt;i&gt;Hohenzollernbrücke&lt;i&gt; (Hohenzollern Bridge) was constructed between 1907 and 1911 after the old bridge, the &lt;i&gt;Dombrücke&lt;i&gt; (Cathedral Bridge) was demolished. It consists of multiple bow-string cantilevers. This was one of the most important bridges in Germany during World War II but German military engineers blew up the bridge when Allied troops began their assault on Cologne. Three years later, the Hohenzollern Bridge was accessible to pedestrians again and full usage was restored by 1959. Today, more than 1200 trains a day use the Hohenzollern Bridge - the highest usage of any rail bridge in Germany.

Remarkably, this station is adjacent to the huge medieval cathedral of Cologne (out of sight here, away to the R) and makes a striking contrast of styles, function and history. This view shows the SE end of the station. &lt;b&gt;Photo&lt;b&gt; Brian © Darkroom Daze &lt;a href&quot;http:bit.ly47tbGf&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;a&gt;.

This view is taken from the window of the Ibis hotel, which is integral with the station frontage on the western side of the station. The inner side of the hotel overlooks the station platforms like this with a side view across the main platform area under the great arched canopy. The canopy arches can just be seen through the upper windows in this view. The canopy dates back to 1894 though subsequently rebuilt. Remarkably, this station is adjacent to the huge medieval cathedral of Cologne (out of sight here, away to the R) and makes a striking contrast of styles, function and history. The two trains consist of duplex (double-decker) carriages, on local services. &lt;b&gt;Photo&lt;b&gt; Brian © Darkroom Daze &lt;a href&quot;http:bit.ly47tbGf&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;a&gt;.
