Snake mountain is a design practice adopted in Teotihuican as well as the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. Though brought to its full artistic maturity in Chichén Itzá, the design is much older than any of these cities. There are examples of the Snake Mountain design at Waxaktun and at Cerros as early as 100 BC. The upright bodies of the snakes that act as supports for the upper temple are meant to represent the &amp;quot;Kuxan Sum&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Living cord&amp;quot; that connected the rulers of the earth with their gods. Nowhere in the Mayan world is there a larger or more impressive representation of the Snake Mountain design than in El Castillo, nor one with as much functionality. Snake Mountain was also where Xmucane, the first mother, used maize dough to mold the first humans at the beginning of the fourth creation. A small doorway on the west face of the northern stairs is the only access up a small stairway to the inner temple beneath. In this inner temple is another Chaac Mool and a jaguar throne, sealed off to tourists by an iron gate.</field> <field name="id">4640150206</field> <field name="location">0,0</field><field name="license">5</field><field name="nbComments">45</field><field name="rank">190</field><field name="tags">travel mountain holiday mexico nikon ruins maya snake yucatan free chichenitza mayan dennis jarvis 2010 thecastle elcastillo d300 iamcanadian snakemountain 18200vr 70300mmvr dennisjarvis pyramidofkukulkan archer10 dennisgjarvis</field><field name="title">Mexico-6004 - Snake Mountain</field><field name="url_b">http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4026/4640150206_d2bee9d48c_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">archer10 (Dennis)</field><field name="poi">aztec ruins</field><field name="date_taken">2010-05-04T11:58:52Z</field><field name="description">PLEASE, no multi invitations in your comments.

Starting from the left: Bolivia - my first whistle from the pre Inca site of Tiwanaku China - made from stone Turkey - put water in it and the sound is great Mexico - a Aztec warrior from Teotihuacan Belize - from the Mayan site of Lubantuun, modeled after whistles found at the site. Vietnam - a glazed water buffalo from Hoi Thailand - not a whistle - stroke the back with the stick and makes a great frog sound. Each of these costs between $1 - $5 US, a cheap collection, does not take much room and the kids love them.</field> <field name="id">4318799700</field> <field name="location">0,0</field><field name="license">5</field><field name="nbComments">75</field><field name="rank">236</field><field name="tags">china trip travel holiday history southamerica inca turkey mexico thailand temple nikon ruins tour belize free bolivia vietnam dennis jarvis whistle whistles sites d300 iamcanadian 18200vr worldtravels dennisjarvis archer10 dennisgjarvis</field><field name="title">DGJ_4759 - Blow..........</field><field name="url_b">http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4030/4318799700_c697fd43cc_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">archer10 (Dennis)</field><field name="poi">aztec ruins</field><field name="date_taken">2007-02-27T04:25:57Z</field><field name="description">PLEASE, no multi invitations, glitters or self promotion in your comments.

The literal English translation of &amp;quot;Comalcalco&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;In the house of the comals&amp;quot;. A &amp;quot;comal&amp;quot; is a tortilla-pan. Although this is a name given by Aztecs recently the Maya name has been deciphered and it is &amp;quot;JOY CHAN&amp;quot; (knotted ceiling). It is the western most known Maya settlement. The Mayan ruins at Comalcalco are a mystery to archaeologists and other researchers studying the unique architectural style of the ancient city. Other Mesoamerican sites of the Maya, were built using hand carved limestone blocks - not bricks. This is the only Mayan pyramid built from fired bricks. When an oyster-base mortar used to bind the bricks was removed, it revealed various odd markings on the back of the bricks, including what is believed to be the brick maker’s fingerprints.</field> <field name="id">2213925341</field> <field name="location">18.153681,-93.23822</field><field name="license">5</field><field name="nbComments">122</field><field name="rank">237</field><field name="tags">brick mexico ancient ruins pyramid maya free mayan western dennis archer olmec mesoamerican iamcanadian comalcalco worldtravels dennisjarvis archer10 dennisgjarvis oysterbase</field><field name="title">Mexico-3070 - Comalcalco - the only Mayan Brick Pyramid</field><field name="url_b">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2342/2213925341_09d2d6fb82_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">archer10 (Dennis)</field><field name="poi">aztec ruins</field><field name="date_taken">2007-03-01T03:19:51Z</field><field name="description">PLEASE, no multi invitations, glitters or self promotion in your comments.

Thanks Pyramid of the Moon, associated by the Aztecs with the moon and water goddess Chalchiuhtlicue. It is 46 meters high, divided into four massive tiers with a monumental south-facing stairway. The pyramid was constructed between 200 and 450 A.D. Tunnels dug into the structure have revealed that over a period of several hundred years, the pyramid underwent at least six facelifts and each new addition was larger and covered the previous structure. There is a tomb apparently made to dedicate the fifth phase of construction. It contains four human skeletons, animal bones, jewelry, obsidian blades, and a wide variety of other offerings. Archeologists estimated that the burial occurred between 100 and 200 A.D. Another tomb dedicated to Chalchiuhtlicue was discovered in 2007. It is dated to the fourth stage of construction. It contained a single human male sacrificial victim as well as a wolf, jaguar, puma, serpent, bird skeletons, and more than 400 other relics which include a large greenstone and obsidian figurines, ceremonial knives, and spear points.
