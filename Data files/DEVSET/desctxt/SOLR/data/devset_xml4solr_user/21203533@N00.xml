The site is located in the northern Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, about 90 miles from the coast. The south half of the site, called Old Chichén, was constructed beginning about 700 AD, by Puuc Maya emigres from the southern Yucatan. The Puuc built temples and palaces at Chichén Itzá including the Red House (Casa Colorada) and the Nunnery (Casa de las Monejas). The Toltec component of Chichén Itzá arrived from &lt;a href&quot;http:archaeology.about.comodttermsgtula.htm&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tula&lt;a&gt; about 950 AD and their influence can be seen in the the Osario (the High Priest&apos;s Grave), and the Eagle and Jaguar Platforms. Most interestingly, a cosmopolitan blending of the two created the Observatory (the Caracol) and the Temple of the Warriors.

Most interestingly, a cosmopolitan blending of the two created the Observatory (the Caracol) and the Temple of the Warriors. Beginning about 950 AD, a new style of architecture crept into the buildings at Chichén Itzá, no doubt along with the people and the culture: The &lt;a href&quot;http:archaeology.about.comodttermsgtoltec.htm&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Toltecs&lt;a&gt;. The term &apos;Toltecs&apos; means a lot of things to a lot of people, but in this feature we&apos;re talking about people from the town of &lt;a href&quot;http:archaeology.about.comodttermsgtula.htm&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tula&lt;a&gt;, in what is now Hidalgo state, Mexico, who began to expand their dynastic control into distant regions of Mesoamerica from the fall of Teotihuacan to the 12th century AD. While the exact relationship between the Itzas and the Toltecs from Tula is complex, it is certain that major changes in architecture and iconography took place at Chichén Itzá as a result of an influx of Toltec people. The result was probably a ruling class made up of Yucatec Maya, Toltecs, and Itzas; it is possible that some of the Maya were also at Tula. Toltec style includes the presence of the feathered or plumed serpent, called Kukulcan or Quetzalcoatl, chacmools, the Tzompantli skull rack, and Toltec warriors. They are probably the impetus for the increase of emphasis on death culture at Chichén Itzá and elsewhere, including the frequency of human sacrifice and warfare. Architecturally, the elements of colonnades and columned halls with wall benches; pyramids are built of stacked platforms of decreasing size in the &amp;quot;tablud and tablero&amp;quot; style which developed at Teotihuacan. Tablud and tablero refers to the angled stair-step profile of the stacked platform pyramid, seen in the profile of El Castillo.

The site is located in the northern Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, about 90 miles from the coast. The south half of the site, called Old Chichén, was constructed beginning about 700 AD, by Puuc Maya emigres from the southern Yucatan. The Puuc built temples and palaces at Chichén Itzá including the Red House (Casa Colorada) and the Nunnery (Casa de las Monejas). The Toltec component of Chichén Itzá arrived from &lt;a href&quot;http:archaeology.about.comodttermsgtula.htm&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tula&lt;a&gt; about 950 AD and their influence can be seen in the the Osario (the High Priest&apos;s Grave), and the Eagle and Jaguar Platforms. Most interestingly, a cosmopolitan blending of the two created the Observatory (the Caracol) and the Temple of the Warriors. Beginning about 950 AD, a new style of architecture crept into the buildings at Chichén Itzá, no doubt along with the people and the culture: The &lt;a href&quot;http:archaeology.about.comodttermsgtoltec.htm&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Toltecs&lt;a&gt;. The term &apos;Toltecs&apos; means a lot of things to a lot of people, but in this feature we&apos;re talking about people from the town of &lt;a href&quot;http:archaeology.about.comodttermsgtula.htm&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tula&lt;a&gt;, in what is now Hidalgo state, Mexico, who began to expand their dynastic control into distant regions of Mesoamerica from the fall of Teotihuacan to the 12th century AD. While the exact relationship between the Itzas and the Toltecs from Tula is complex, it is certain that major changes in architecture and iconography took place at Chichén Itzá as a result of an influx of Toltec people. The result was probably a ruling class made up of Yucatec Maya, Toltecs, and Itzas; it is possible that some of the Maya were also at Tula. Toltec style includes the presence of the feathered or plumed serpent, called Kukulcan or Quetzalcoatl, chacmools, the Tzompantli skull rack, and Toltec warriors. They are probably the impetus for the increase of emphasis on death culture at Chichén Itzá and elsewhere, including the frequency of human sacrifice and warfare. Architecturally, the elements of colonnades and columned halls with wall benches; pyramids are built of stacked platforms of decreasing size in the &amp;quot;tablud and tablero&amp;quot; style which developed at Teotihuacan. Tablud and tablero refers to the angled stair-step profile of the stacked platform pyramid, seen in the profile of El Castillo.

Most interestingly, a cosmopolitan blending of the two created the Observatory (the Caracol) and the Temple of the Warriors. The Nunnery is strictly a Puuc style building, named Casa de las Monjas by the Spanish who were reminded of convent buildings back home. This building is considered by most a residential palace, but scholars are divided as to whether it represents the residence of the founding family of Chichén or a priest&apos;s house, or a Popal Nah (or council house) structure. The building has five dedicatory glyph strings, one of which dates it to AD 880. The original building was constructed on a 30 foot high platform, with two wings and a central reinforced wall. During a later remodeling, the base was widened and a second floor added. Above the second floor is a mat-weave lattice. The decoration and architecture is typically Puuc Maya. The rubble core walls were originally veneered with indented stepped frets in cubes decorated with flowers. A sacrificial stone is in front of this building, and a jaguar throne was found within, showing its continued use after the Toltec arrival.

The site is located in the northern Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, about 90 miles from the coast. The south half of the site, called Old Chichén, was constructed beginning about 700 AD, by Puuc Maya emigres from the southern Yucatan. The Puuc built temples and palaces at Chichén Itzá including the Red House (Casa Colorada) and the Nunnery (Casa de las Monejas). The Toltec component of Chichén Itzá arrived from &lt;a href&quot;http:archaeology.about.comodttermsgtula.htm&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tula&lt;a&gt; about 950 AD and their influence can be seen in the the Osario (the High Priest&apos;s Grave), and the Eagle and Jaguar Platforms. Most interestingly, a cosmopolitan blending of the two created the Observatory (the Caracol) and the Temple of the Warriors. The Observatory at Chichén Itzá is called el Caracol (or snail in Spanish) because it has an interior staircase that spirals upward like a snail&apos;s shell. The round, concentrically-vaulted Caracol was built and rebuilt several times over its use, in part, scholars believe, to calibrate the astronomical observations. The first structure was probably built here during the transition period of the late 9th century and consisted of a large rectangular platform with a stairway on its west side. A round tower of about 48 feet high was built atop the platform, with a solid lower body, a central portion with two circular galleries and a spiral staircase and an observation chamber on the top. Later, a circular and then a rectangular platform was added. The windows in the Caracol point in the cardinal and subcardinal directions and are believed to enable the tracking of the movement of Venus, the Pleides, the sun and the moon and other celestial events. Mayanist J. Eric Thompson once described the Observatory as &amp;quot;hideous... a two-decker wedding cake on the square carton in which it came.&amp;quot; For a complete discussion of the archaeoastronomy of el Caracol, see Anthony Aveni&apos;s classic &lt;a href&quot;http:archaeology.about.comodarchaeoastronomyfraveni.htm&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Skywatchers&lt;a&gt;.
