On Sunday morning Gabi had organized an Advent Brunch meeting for us and invited some other Couchsurfers too. The meeting took place in Brauhaus Rixdorf in Neukölln. We had to hurry as Danny had trouble waking up, so we got there by car. Ulrich and Christian were already in the building when we arrived and some other Couchsurfers joined us later. The Brauhaus is a cosy place with a very mixed public and funny drawings on the walls. The food was not typically for breakfast: heavy greasy warm meals with a lot of meat. At least very effective to get rid of a hangover and good to spend almost all day chatting. And that&apos;s what we did. But we left before 15 h, otherwise we would not be able to see the Neues Museum. Ulrich had arranged online tickets to get into the museum. At least Jeroen and Rajesh should see something of Berlin on thier first day in Berlin.
