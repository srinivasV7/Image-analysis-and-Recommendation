Salmon Ruins and Heritage Park, with more ancestral Pueblo structures, lies a short distance to the south, just west of Bloomfield near the San Juan River. The buildings date back to the 11th to 13th centuries, and the misnomer attributing them to the Aztec civilization can be traced back to early American settlers in the mid-19th century. The actual construction was by the ancestral Puebloans, the Anasazi. The site was declared &amp;quot;Aztec Ruin National Monument&amp;quot; on January 24, 1923, and with a boundary change it was renamed &amp;quot;Ruins&amp;quot; on July 2, 1928. As an historical property of the National Park Service the National Monument was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Aztec Ruins was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, as part of the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, on December 8, 1987. Anasazi settlements in North America started during the late 11th century and ran until around 1300. The Anasazi are believed to most likely have moved from these ruins into neighboring areas such as the present day Hopi and Navajo reserves and the pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley. These relocations occurred due to drought or loss of nearby fertile land. With no humans living within these, what are now ruins, their settlements slowly were covered by sand and were untouched until the mid-1800s. These ruins would not receive official protection until 1923 when the national monument was established. &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiAztec_Ruins_National_Monument&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiAztec_Ruins_National_Monument&lt;a&gt; &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;a&gt;</field> <field name="id">4854744915</field> <field name="location">36.834156,-108.000562</field><field name="license">5</field><field name="nbComments">0</field><field name="rank">34</field><field name="tags">newmexico aztec sanjuan</field><field name="title">Aztec Ruins National Monument, Aztec, New Mexico</field><field name="url_b">http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4854744915_9dce9108f8_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">Ken Lund</field><field name="poi">aztec ruins</field><field name="date_taken">2010-08-01T09:38:24Z</field><field name="description">The Aztec Ruins National Monument preserves ancestral Pueblo structures in north-western New Mexico, United States, located close to the town of Aztec and northeast of Farmington, near the Animas River.

It has two large plazas (Civic Center Plaza and United Nations Plaza) and a number of buildings in classical architectural style. The Bill Graham Civic Auditorium (formerly the Exposition Auditorium) is one of the few remaining buildings from the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition. The United Nations Charter was signed in the War Memorial Veterans Building&apos;s Herbst Theatre in 1945, leading to the creation of the United Nations. It is also where the 1951 Treaty of San Francisco (the peace treaty that officially ended the Pacific War with the Empire of Japan, which had surrendered in 1945) was signed. The San Francisco Civic Center was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987, and listed in the National Register of Historic Places on October 10, 1978. The Civic Center is bounded by Market Street on the south, Franklin Street on the west, Turk Street on the north, and Leavenworth and Seventh streets on the east. The Civic Center is bounded by the Tenderloin neighborhood on the north and east and by the Hayes Valley neighborhood on the west; Market Street separates it from the South of Market or &amp;quot;SoMa&amp;quot; neighborhood. Its central location, vast open space, and the collection of government buildings have made and continue to make Civic Center the scene of massive political rallies. It has been the scene of massive anti-war protests and rallies since the Korean War. A monument to James Lick and the Manifest Destiny is located in the middle of Fulton Street between the Library and the Asian Art Museum. The section of Fulton Street between Hyde and Leavenworth streets was pedestrianized and re-developed into a monument for the United Nations and the signing of the UN Charter in 1975, when the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway was constructed under Market Street. The 2.6-acre (11,000 m2) pedestrian mall was designed by Lawrence Halprin. It was rededicated in June 1995 by visiting members of the UN General Assembly as part of its 60th anniversary, and renovated and rededicated again in 2005 during the World Environment Day event. Currently, it is the site of a small farmers&apos; market as well as a large equestrian statue of Simon Bolivar. Because the Civic Center is located near the skid row Tenderloin neighborhood, it has a seedy, run-down, high-crime reputation and appearance with large amounts of homeless encampments, which have prevented it from attracting the large amounts of tourists seen in other areas of the city. Despite repeated redevelopment of Civic Center over the years aimed primarily at discouraging the homeless from camping there, large numbers of homeless continue to camp and loiter in the area. &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiCivic_Center,_San_Francisco&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiCivic_Center,_San_Francisco&lt;a&gt; &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;a&gt;</field> <field name="id">10753856126</field> <field name="location">37.780314,-122.418562</field><field name="license">5</field><field name="nbComments">0</field><field name="rank">17</field><field name="tags">sanfrancisco vision:mountain0592 vision:outdoor0987 vision:sky0621</field><field name="title">Civic Center, San Francisco, California</field><field name="url_b">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3739/10753856126_5508249403_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">Ken Lund</field><field name="poi">civic center san francisco</field><field name="date_taken">2013-11-07T01:28:04Z</field><field name="description">The Civic Center in San Francisco, California, is an area of a few blocks north of the intersection of Market Street and Van Ness Avenue that contains many of the city&apos;s largest government and cultural institutions.

The 2.6-acre (11,000 m2) pedestrian mall was designed by Lawrence Halprin. It was rededicated in June 1995 by visiting members of the UN General Assembly as part of its 60th anniversary, and renovated and rededicated again in 2005 during the World Environment Day event. Currently, it is the site of a small farmers&apos; market as well as a large equestrian statue of Simon Bolivar. Because the Civic Center is located near the skid row Tenderloin neighborhood, it has a seedy, run-down, high-crime reputation and appearance with large amounts of homeless encampments, which have prevented it from attracting the large amounts of tourists seen in other areas of the city. Despite repeated redevelopment of Civic Center over the years aimed primarily at discouraging the homeless from camping there, large numbers of homeless continue to camp and loiter in the area. &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiCivic_Center,_San_Francisco&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiCivic_Center,_San_Francisco&lt;a&gt; &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;a&gt;</field> <field name="id">10753860484</field> <field name="location">37.779839,-122.415204</field><field name="license">5</field><field name="nbComments">0</field><field name="rank">23</field><field name="tags">sanfrancisco vision:mountain0677 vision:outdoor099 vision:sky0912</field><field name="title">Simon Bolivar Statue, United Nations Plaza, Civic Center, San Francisco, California</field><field name="url_b">http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5543/10753860484_35c9fd6cf5_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">Ken Lund</field><field name="poi">civic center san francisco</field><field name="date_taken">2013-11-07T06:25:16Z</field><field name="description">Polk Street is a street in San Francisco, California, that travels northward from Market Street to Beach Street and is one of the main thoroughfares of the Polk Gulch neighborhood traversing through the Tenderloin, Nob Hill, and Russian Hill neighborhoods. The street takes its name from former U.S. President James K. Polk. The street remains a busy business district with many restaurants, cafes, home decorating and hardware stores. The street also has bike lanes, which were approved in 2002. San Francisco bike route 25 runs along Polk Street, and is the only North-South route suitable for casual bicycle travel within at least a mile in either direction. There is an ongoing debate on whether to increase the level of these improvements. &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiPolk_Street&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiPolk_Street&lt;a&gt; &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;a&gt;</field> <field name="id">10754361846</field> <field name="location">37.778542,-122.418283</field><field name="license">5</field><field name="nbComments">0</field><field name="rank">76</field><field name="tags">sanfrancisco vision:outdoor0975 vision:sky057 vision:street0941</field><field name="title">Polk Street, Civic Center, San Francisco, California</field><field name="url_b">http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7341/10754361846_be3d6cd3ca_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">Ken Lund</field><field name="poi">civic center san francisco</field><field name="date_taken">2013-11-07T06:24:54Z</field><field name="description">The Asian Art Museum of San Francisco is a museum in San Francisco, California, United States. It has one of the most comprehensive collections of Asian art in the world. The collection has approximately 18,000 works of art and artifacts from all major Asian countries and traditions, some of which are as much as 6,000 years old. Major galleries are devoted to the arts of South Asia, West Asia (including Persia), Southeast Asia, the Himalayas, China, Korea and Japan. There are 2,500 works on display in the permanent collection. The museum has become a focus for special and traveling exhibitions, including: the first major Chinese exhibition to travel outside China since the end of World War II (in 1975), an archaeological exhibition which attracted 800,000 visitors over an eight-week period, and an exhibition on wisdom and compassion opened by the Dalai Lama in 1991. &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiAsian_Art_Museum_of_San_Francisco&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiAsian_Art_Museum_of_San_Francisco&lt;a&gt; &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiUnited_States_District_Court_for_the_Northern_District_of_California&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiUnited_States_District_Court_for_th...&lt;a&gt;</field> <field name="id">10754359856</field> <field name="location">37.778542,-122.418283</field><field name="license">5</field><field name="nbComments">0</field><field name="rank">77</field><field name="tags">sanfrancisco vision:outdoor099 vision:sky0964 vision:clouds0716</field><field name="title">Asian Art Museum, Civic Center, San Francisco, California</field><field name="url_b">http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7391/10754359856_722d904d98_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">Ken Lund</field><field name="poi">civic center san francisco</field><field name="date_taken">2013-11-07T01:28:17Z</field><field name="description">The Asian Art Museum of San Francisco is a museum in San Francisco, California, United States.

It is one of the largest performing arts centers in the United States. It covers 7.5 acres (3 hectares) in the Civic Center Historic District, and totals 7,500 seats among its venues. The complex was developed in the 1920s on two blocks on Van Ness Avenue facing San Francisco City Hall from the west. The &amp;quot;War Memorial&amp;quot; name commemorates all the people who served in the First World War, which ended seven years before the project commenced. It was designed by Arthur Brown Jr in 1927-1928, and is one of the last Beaux-Arts style structures erected in the United States. The project resulted in the construction of a matched pair of buildings across a formal courtyard park: the War Memorial Opera House; and the multi-purpose Veterans Building next door. Both were completed and opened in 1932. The SFWMPAC has historical significance. In 1945, the United Nations Charter was signed in the Veterans Building&apos;s Herbst Theatre by the group of 50 founding nations, following the two-month-long United Nations conference in the Opera House. In 1951, the Treaty of San Francisco, formally ending World War II hostilities with Japan, was signed in the Opera House. The Center has been host to U.S. presidents and foreign heads of state. In 1990 the Center was chosen to host the first Goldman Environmental Prize ceremony, and this prize is now presented annually at the Center. &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiSan_Francisco_War_Memorial_and_Performing_Arts_Center&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiSan_Francisco_War_Memorial_and_Perf...&lt;a&gt; &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;a&gt;</field> <field name="id">10754351066</field> <field name="location">37.779016,-122.421748</field><field name="license">5</field><field name="nbComments">0</field><field name="rank">91</field><field name="tags">sanfrancisco vision:outdoor099 vision:sky0555</field><field name="title">San Francisco War Memorial and Performing Arts Center, San Francisco, California</field><field name="url_b">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2830/10754351066_18bd556e90_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">Ken Lund</field><field name="poi">civic center san francisco</field><field name="date_taken">2013-11-07T06:21:05Z</field><field name="description">The San Francisco War Memorial and Performing Arts Center (SFWMPAC) is located in San Francisco, California.

The Herbst Theatre, with 916 seats, is a small concert and lecture presentation venue. It is a part of the original Veterans Building and was originally named the “Veterans Auditorium”. In 1945 the original United Nations Charter was signed here. In 1977 the theatre was refurbished and renamed. The Green Room is located on the second floor of the Veterans Building. Originally designed as a lounge for World War I veterans, the room now serves as a performance and reception hall. Several concert and lecture series are held in the Green Room each year, as well as dinners, receptions, fashion shows, recitals, conferences and meetings. The room is also a prime location for fashion photography and video. The San Francisco Arts Commission Gallery is located in the northeast corner of the Veterans Building. The gallery hosts changing exhibitions of contemporary art. &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiSan_Francisco_War_Memorial_and_Performing_Arts_Center&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiSan_Francisco_War_Memorial_and_Perf...&lt;a&gt; &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;a&gt; </field> <field name="id">10754568493</field> <field name="location">37.779016,-122.421748</field><field name="license">5</field><field name="nbComments">0</field><field name="rank">119</field><field name="tags">sanfrancisco vision:mountain0656 vision:outdoor099 vision:sky0832 vision:clouds0502</field><field name="title">Veterans Building, San Francisco War Memorial and Performing Arts Center, San Francisco, California</field><field name="url_b">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2820/10754568493_e41144e13b_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">Ken Lund</field><field name="poi">civic center san francisco</field><field name="date_taken">2013-11-07T01:18:22Z</field><field name="description">The Civic Center in San Francisco, California, is an area of a few blocks north of the intersection of Market Street and Van Ness Avenue that contains many of the city&apos;s largest government and cultural institutions. It has two large plazas (Civic Center Plaza and United Nations Plaza) and a number of buildings in classical architectural style. The Bill Graham Civic Auditorium (formerly the Exposition Auditorium) is one of the few remaining buildings from the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition. The United Nations Charter was signed in the War Memorial Veterans Building&apos;s Herbst Theatre in 1945, leading to the creation of the United Nations. It is also where the 1951 Treaty of San Francisco (the peace treaty that officially ended the Pacific War with the Empire of Japan, which had surrendered in 1945) was signed. The San Francisco Civic Center was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987, and listed in the National Register of Historic Places on October 10, 1978. The Civic Center is bounded by Market Street on the south, Franklin Street on the west, Turk Street on the north, and Leavenworth and Seventh streets on the east. The Civic Center is bounded by the Tenderloin neighborhood on the north and east and by the Hayes Valley neighborhood on the west; Market Street separates it from the South of Market or &amp;quot;SoMa&amp;quot; neighborhood. Its central location, vast open space, and the collection of government buildings have made and continue to make Civic Center the scene of massive political rallies. It has been the scene of massive anti-war protests and rallies since the Korean War. A monument to James Lick and the Manifest Destiny is located in the middle of Fulton Street between the Library and the Asian Art Museum. The section of Fulton Street between Hyde and Leavenworth streets was pedestrianized and re-developed into a monument for the United Nations and the signing of the UN Charter in 1975, when the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway was constructed under Market Street. The 2.6-acre (11,000 m2) pedestrian mall was designed by Lawrence Halprin. It was rededicated in June 1995 by visiting members of the UN General Assembly as part of its 60th anniversary, and renovated and rededicated again in 2005 during the World Environment Day event. Currently, it is the site of a small farmers&apos; market as well as a large equestrian statue of Simon Bolivar. Because the Civic Center is located near the skid row Tenderloin neighborhood, it has a seedy, run-down, high-crime reputation and appearance with large amounts of homeless encampments, which have prevented it from attracting the large amounts of tourists seen in other areas of the city. Despite repeated redevelopment of Civic Center over the years aimed primarily at discouraging the homeless from camping there, large numbers of homeless continue to camp and loiter in the area. &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiCivic_Center,_San_Francisco&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiCivic_Center,_San_Francisco&lt;a&gt; &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiWikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...&lt;a&gt;</field> <field name="id">10753820836</field> <field name="location">37.780144,-122.41353</field><field name="license">5</field><field name="nbComments">0</field><field name="rank">167</field><field name="tags">sanfrancisco vision:text0589 vision:outdoor0899 vision:sky0667</field><field name="title">Map of San Francisco, United Nations Plaza, San Francisco, California</field><field name="url_b">http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5516/10753820836_1d167c758d_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">Ken Lund</field><field name="poi">civic center san francisco</field><field name="date_taken">2010-12-17T14:33:26Z</field><field name="description">Walnut Canyon National Monument is a United States National Monument located about 10 mi (16 km) southeast of downtown Flagstaff, Arizona, just off Interstate 40. The canyon rim lies at 6,690 ft (2,040 m); the canyon&apos;s floor is 350 ft lower. A 0.9 mi (1.4 km) long loop trail descends 185 ft (56 m) into the canyon passing 25 cliff dwelling rooms constructed by the Sinagua, a pre-Columbian cultural group that lived in Walnut Canyon from about 1100 to 1250 CE. Other contemporary habitations of the Sinagua people are preserved in the nearby Tuzigoot and Montezuma Castle national monuments. The Sinagua, who inhabitanted the dwellings in Walnut Canyon, left mysteriously around 1250 CE. It is thought that the Sinagua left because of fear of neighboring tribes or droughts, but it is not certain. The disappearance of the Sinagua left over 80 cliff dwellings behind. The dwellings themselves were small but large enough for the inhabitants to still be able to cook and sleep. Most of the cliff dwelling rooms are situated near the loop trail, typically slightly above the trail and immediately outside the loop itself. A typical room might have been the dwelling of a single family, and might measure approximately two meters high by six meters long by three meters deep. Because of the area&apos;s dry climate, the water present in the canyon was essential for its inhabitants over 700 years ago as it is for the animal and plant life that exists there today. There are many more dwellings to be seen up close in the canyon just east of the Monument, although it is illegal to actually enter the canyon because of the park&apos;s rules and regulations. Walnut Canyon was proclaimed a national monument on November 30, 1915 by President Woodrow Wilson in order to preserve the ancient cliff dwellings. It was transferred from the USDA Forest Service to the National Park Service on August 10, 1933. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the national monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. At Walnut Canyon, there are trails for tourists to get a close view of the dwellings. Walnut Canyon lies on the Colorado Plateau and cuts through the Permian Kaibab Limestone, which exposes the Toroweap Formation and Coconino Sandstone. The Kaibab formation also forms the rim of the Grand Canyon. Crossbedding is present in the Coconino Sandstone. Not all of Arizona is warm dry desert. At Walnut Canyon (6690&apos;2039m above sea level), be prepared for snow in winter, hot sun in summer with afternoon thunderstorms, and, especially in spring, strong gusty winds on the rim andor in the canyon. Even though the climate was and still is somewhat harsh, the Sinagua Indians that lived there were able to harvest maize, beans and squash. Park entrance road, trails, and Visitor Center are open all year, except December 25. From May till October the monument is open from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. MST and is open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. MST the rest of the year.

A 0.9 mi (1.4 km) long loop trail descends 185 ft (56 m) into the canyon passing 25 cliff dwelling rooms constructed by the Sinagua, a pre-Columbian cultural group that lived in Walnut Canyon from about 1100 to 1250 CE. Other contemporary habitations of the Sinagua people are preserved in the nearby Tuzigoot and Montezuma Castle national monuments. The Sinagua, who inhabitanted the dwellings in Walnut Canyon, left mysteriously around 1250 CE. It is thought that the Sinagua left because of fear of neighboring tribes or droughts, but it is not certain. The disappearance of the Sinagua left over 80 cliff dwellings behind. The dwellings themselves were small but large enough for the inhabitants to still be able to cook and sleep. Most of the cliff dwelling rooms are situated near the loop trail, typically slightly above the trail and immediately outside the loop itself. A typical room might have been the dwelling of a single family, and might measure approximately two meters high by six meters long by three meters deep. Because of the area&apos;s dry climate, the water present in the canyon was essential for its inhabitants over 700 years ago as it is for the animal and plant life that exists there today. There are many more dwellings to be seen up close in the canyon just east of the Monument, although it is illegal to actually enter the canyon because of the park&apos;s rules and regulations. Walnut Canyon was proclaimed a national monument on November 30, 1915 by President Woodrow Wilson in order to preserve the ancient cliff dwellings. It was transferred from the USDA Forest Service to the National Park Service on August 10, 1933. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the national monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. At Walnut Canyon, there are trails for tourists to get a close view of the dwellings. Walnut Canyon lies on the Colorado Plateau and cuts through the Permian Kaibab Limestone, which exposes the Toroweap Formation and Coconino Sandstone. The Kaibab formation also forms the rim of the Grand Canyon. Crossbedding is present in the Coconino Sandstone. Not all of Arizona is warm dry desert. At Walnut Canyon (6690&apos;2039m above sea level), be prepared for snow in winter, hot sun in summer with afternoon thunderstorms, and, especially in spring, strong gusty winds on the rim andor in the canyon. Even though the climate was and still is somewhat harsh, the Sinagua Indians that lived there were able to harvest maize, beans and squash. Park entrance road, trails, and Visitor Center are open all year, except December 25. From May till October the monument is open from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. MST and is open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. MST the rest of the year. Entry to park trails closes 1 hour before the monument closes. &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiWalnut_Canyon_National_Monument&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiWalnut_Canyon_National_Monument&lt;a&gt;</field> <field name="id">5271356488</field> <field name="location">35.174334,-111.506552</field><field name="license">5</field><field name="nbComments">0</field><field name="rank">267</field><field name="tags">arizona</field><field name="title">Welcome to Walnut Canyon National Monument, Arizona</field><field name="url_b">http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5242/5271356488_4c90df2778_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">Ken Lund</field><field name="poi">montezuma castle</field><field name="date_taken">2010-12-17T14:24:27Z</field><field name="description">Walnut Canyon National Monument is a United States National Monument located about 10 mi (16 km) southeast of downtown Flagstaff, Arizona, just off Interstate 40.

The Kaibab formation also forms the rim of the Grand Canyon. Crossbedding is present in the Coconino Sandstone. Not all of Arizona is warm dry desert. At Walnut Canyon (6690&apos;2039m above sea level), be prepared for snow in winter, hot sun in summer with afternoon thunderstorms, and, especially in spring, strong gusty winds on the rim andor in the canyon. Even though the climate was and still is somewhat harsh, the Sinagua Indians that lived there were able to harvest maize, beans and squash. Park entrance road, trails, and Visitor Center are open all year, except December 25. From May till October the monument is open from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. MST and is open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. MST the rest of the year. Entry to park trails closes 1 hour before the monument closes. &lt;a href&quot;http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiWalnut_Canyon_National_Monument&quot; rel&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.orgwikiWalnut_Canyon_National_Monument&lt;a&gt;</field> <field name="id">5270767869</field> <field name="location">35.171352,-111.50947</field><field name="license">5</field><field name="nbComments">0</field><field name="rank">274</field><field name="tags">arizona</field><field name="title">Walnut Canyon National Monument Cliff Dwellings</field><field name="url_b">http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5282/5270767869_2573a528ab_b.jpg</field><field name="views">0</field><field name="username">Ken Lund</field><field name="poi">montezuma castle</field><field name="date_taken">2010-12-17T14:23:32Z</field><field name="description">Walnut Canyon National Monument is a United States National Monument located about 10 mi (16 km) southeast of downtown Flagstaff, Arizona, just off Interstate 40. The canyon rim lies at 6,690 ft (2,040 m); the canyon&apos;s floor is 350 ft lower. A 0.9 mi (1.4 km) long loop trail descends 185 ft (56 m) into the canyon passing 25 cliff dwelling rooms constructed by the Sinagua, a pre-Columbian cultural group that lived in Walnut Canyon from about 1100 to 1250 CE. Other contemporary habitations of the Sinagua people are preserved in the nearby Tuzigoot and Montezuma Castle national monuments. The Sinagua, who inhabitanted the dwellings in Walnut Canyon, left mysteriously around 1250 CE. It is thought that the Sinagua left because of fear of neighboring tribes or droughts, but it is not certain. The disappearance of the Sinagua left over 80 cliff dwellings behind. The dwellings themselves were small but large enough for the inhabitants to still be able to cook and sleep. Most of the cliff dwelling rooms are situated near the loop trail, typically slightly above the trail and immediately outside the loop itself. A typical room might have been the dwelling of a single family, and might measure approximately two meters high by six meters long by three meters deep. Because of the area&apos;s dry climate, the water present in the canyon was essential for its inhabitants over 700 years ago as it is for the animal and plant life that exists there today. There are many more dwellings to be seen up close in the canyon just east of the Monument, although it is illegal to actually enter the canyon because of the park&apos;s rules and regulations. Walnut Canyon was proclaimed a national monument on November 30, 1915 by President Woodrow Wilson in order to preserve the ancient cliff dwellings. It was transferred from the USDA Forest Service to the National Park Service on August 10, 1933.
